"Seafood Parmigiana -- breaded shrimp topped with crabmeat & melted Provolone and spaghetti marinara on the side. The Parmigiana part was tasty and perfectly cooked, and the sauce was good, but the pasta was overcooked. Salad was the usual iceberg lettuce, tomato & cucumber, nothing special. Ambiance is the typical mid-scale bar/restaurant. We did get a small glass of Chianti on the house.",3.0,1,1

By far my favorite Starbucks! I've been going there since I started school in May and all the employees are so sweet! But Max is definitely my favorite and always puts a huge smile on my face when he hands over my drink. Thank you starbies for being my favorite way to start the day.,5.0,2,2
"For a first experience in New Orleans I can't be mad at our choice of Oceana Grill. Even if it becomes later known to be not real or authentic, it was very good to us. The building is pretty cool. Gave me a sense of being in college and going to the bar. I suspect prepandemic that this place probably was/is a lot of fun. 

We started off with the Cajun fries and added the crocodile. Crocodile is a happy surprise! Texture is good, and the Cajun seasoning made those little bomb bites delicious. The sauce on the fries was super rich, but in a good way. We probably could have had it as a meal and been full. 

I ordered the red beans and rice. It is a very flavorful dish. My daughter got the jambalaya Cajun pasta. That was also fire. My other daughter blackened catfish. Both plates consumed by kids, and if kids like it that means it tastes good. The wife chose the crocodile PoBoy. I mean each bite is like a flavor explosion in your mouth. I am pretty confident any item ordered is going to be a good choice. 

We definitely recommend Oceana and appreciate it as a first introduction to Cajun fare.",4.0,2,2
"Well got basically a response that they will relay to unsure who. Said it is their company policy. We have two memberships using a credit card already, but their policy is with direct checking only, hmm.. It is a shame they will not allow us to open one for another family member the same way. Unless you are willing to risk the possibiliy of hack into your checking I do not recommend opening a membership. We will continue taking for free as a guest until they let us get one with a credit card or till me move to a different gym. I left out of first review something else. Everyone was great and nice when wanted and obtained the membership. Now they seem to have no empathy about our concerns and do not seem to care if we get another membership or not. They must feel they have enough and don't care if stay or cancel. Was given a take it or leave it attitude from the GM. They could have at least said let us check if can make an exception see we have two memberahips already using credit card. We are just a number to them the way they act.",1.0,0,0
"The is the ONLY place for cupcakes.  I'm in greedy girl HEAVEN!!!  I found out about this truck during a Groupon promotion.  I'm so sad I've discovered these cupcakes...I crave them ALL the time.  She's the ORIGINAL cupcake truck in Philly - and I will have to admit - I've cheated on her...but there is NO comparison!!  NONE!!

"Came here on a Saturday morning to grab some brunch with friends. Showed up early to make sure we secured our table before our group showed up. We were greeted and seated and after a little bit realized that our table might be a bit small for the amount of people we had. We asked our server Paige if we could move to a bigger table even though it would hangs our server. She quickly replied that we can't do that and that the tab couldn't be moved. This made no sense since plenty of other places allow you to do this all the time. Needless to say, on top of that, we got our first drinks and appetizers and then poof! No sight of our server for quite a while. We ended starting to flag down other servers to try and get service although it didn't seem super busy when we looked around. The rest of our friends for our group showed up and it just continued from there. It was our friends birthday as well and it ended up getting to the point where the manager was called to see if we could get some help. Our friends then got their food and shortly after one of them found a hair in their shrimp po' boy sandwich. It ended up being slow to get a new one that by the time it arrived he just ended up getting a to go box. I did manage to at least have the queso dip with chorizo which was good and the shrimp and grits. The shrimp and grits could use a bit more flavor since the grits infused with cheddar seemed a bit bland. Overall, the service just wasn't the greatest for us as group that day we went. The food was good, but it just didn't make up for the experience we had that day. Hopefully your experience will be better if you go.",2.0,0,0

"Tabitha, the bartender at Bourbon Heat, recommended this restaurant as the best seafood in town. I don't know all the competition but it sure was great! We were in shorts, so had to sit in the bar area, which was just fine!  We had cocktails and wine and all were good. Our dinners included sheepshead fish, John Dory fish, and gnocchi. My sheepshead was cooked perfectly & was delicious, and the brussel sprouts were the best I have ever had!  I tasted the John Dory and it was really good with a very rich sauce. I did not try the gnocchi but my friend said it was good too. The biscuits were good as well. Our server, Cary, was pleasant and efficient and made our experience even better. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you want seafood while visiting The Big Easy!",5.0,2,2
"I've been living in Tucson for five years. Very ashamed to say that I've never tried this place until today. Amazing service, the food came out so fast I I was really shocked, granted I did go to this restaurant at 3 PM maybe that has something to do with it.  Maybe things are slower during the dinner rush. Anyway, the food was absolutely amazing I got a wet burrito with ground beef and rice with beans absolutely great food. The waitresses are amazing very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I definitely will be going back to this establishment. Also must say that the prices were pretty shocking, for the serving sizes, and the quality I would expect it to cost more than the alcoholic beverages were very big very strong very good best that I've had at a restaurant here in Tucson this place is a A+ in my book.",5.0,2,2

"I would not recommend taking a pool sample to this place for help with your pool. I took a sample on Monday afternoon......my pool was starting to turn light green-I was told my ph was low and I had dead/inactive chlorine. I was informed to buy/add 10 lbs of a alkaline product as well as 4 lbs of shock......per instruction, I added the tub of alkaline product, waited 2 hours and then added the shock. I've kept the pump running since as informed so that all of the added chemicals would circulate and I was told to come back in a couple days. Today  is Wednesday (a couple days) and my pool has turned from a light green to a DARK green. I took another sample to the place and was told my Chlorine was too high and they didn't know why-was told just to continue to run my pump and wait a couple of more days. The chemicals I was told would turn my light green pool to a cloudy blue, actually turned my pool DARK green and they took a little over $30 of my money to do so! I was either told to buy/add the wrong chemicals by someone who did not know what they were doing, or I was told to buy stuff I didn't need simply to sell me product I didn't need to increase sales.",1.0,0,0
"I always wait a week before I really assess how a pedicure was to see how it holds up. I am happy to say my toes look just as great like the day I walked out of Coco Nails (a week ago). The salon offers these spa pedicures ""in a box"". It seemed to be some sort of aromatherapy. I chose to have the deluxe pedicure and it was very nice. I like a sugar scrub with my pedicure and there was a very nice citrus one that they did. 

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because although the cost was reasonable, please note that they will charge more if you use a credit card so  be prepared with cash to save a few bucks. I live in the area and will probably use this nail salon often in the future.

***UPDATE: I was contacted by the owner and told that the business is no longer charging more for credit cards. 5 stars it is!",5.0,2,2

"Not really ""plant-based"" as they have eggs ... what! People are eating the menstruations of birds?! ... And calling it food for ascension.  Also they serve some lacto milk cheese butter etc! Telling humans they go higher in vibration by stealing the precious life energy that was intended for the newborn animal yet unable to process it's food of instinctual design.

Get the image aligned with the actions...

Anyway they've got a lot of vegan options, and based on relativity, the place is quite good!  When above matches the below, they will be actually great! instead of just relatively decent.",2.0,0,2
"The food is phenomenal. The only reason I don't give it five stars it's because of poor planning by the management. This place is less than 2 miles from one of the busiest resorts in Tucson. That resort has conferences there year-round. So, why is it that this restaurant is always understaffed and claims they are ""caught off guard"" by the number of people who show up there to eat each evening? We waited an hour to get our food even though they were only four cars in the parking lot. This is unacceptable. We won't be back until they get the management figured out.",4.0,2,0

Most unprofessional etiquette I've experienced at a dealership during the greeting. Called in today to single out what dealerships we'd visit tonight and was told that the bottom dollar on a vehicle ""varied depending on the customer"", which is clearly an absolute lie.

Fantastic little French bistro we visited with a close friend from Tampa.  Located near Indian Rocks Beach.  Enjoyed the spinach quiche while my spouse and friend had the bacon quiche.

Will go again when the opportunity arises.,5.0,2,2

"This is probably one of my favorite dessert places in philly! The cafe is modern and cute. The desserts are beautifully presented and there's a huge variety. They are made in house and have both an European (think French or Italian) and an Asian flair. My go to is always chocolate so I've gotten something chocolate related every time. They have fruit based/tiramisu/panna cotta/cheesecakes/lava cakes/sizzling ice creams, so something for any type of dessert craving! They also have a full coffee/tea bar to fit any type of caffeine need as well as matcha drinks which seem to be a huge fad right now. My most recent visit, I tried the chocolate peanut butter mousse/cake. It was amazing! I don't tend to like green tea but I want to go back and try some of the matcha items. I also want to try the milk foam beverages! Perfect place to stop by after you've had a meal in the area and are craving something sweet. Will be back soon!",5.0,2,2
"So I saw DiNic's on DDD on the Food Network, and of course I had to have the roast pork, provolone and brocolli rabe.  This sandwich is better than a Philly Cheesesteak. I guess I'm not a fan of Velveeta. :)  The bitter of the brocolli rabe, the sharp bite of the provolone and the herby-ness of the pork really made for a yummy combination.  Definitely a must have!",4.0,2,2
"Unbelievably sad at the incredibly poor service received today. Who I assume to be the owner was extremely rude to my group of six friends. We were coming in to grab a few beers/snacks and to spend time on the patio. A member of our group was finishing up some tacos from Parrilla and the owner handled the situation very poorly by yelling and making a scene. While it is understandable that the outside food was not allowed on the patio, I felt that his reaction was uncalled for.  We would have been happy to remedy the situation and remove the tacos but were instead we were asked to leave. I typically love this restaurant and come here often but do not plan on it in the future.",1.0,0,0
"After coming back here a few more times, I have to write a new review.  

First review was 3 stars and they had just opened.  Have been back to twice and they're a solid 4 star.

Pot pie is still the best thing on the menu. The hotel staff at the front door, the restaurant hostesses, and the bar staff are all very friendly and instantly make you feel at ease and welcome.  Wait staff seems to be ontop of their tables and water glasses are never empty, cocktails refreshed frequently and felt no rush to flip our table, despite a growing crowd.  This is a great alternative to the Starr chains and a solid gourmet meal.  The crowd is equal parts dressed up and casual so it really seems there's no scene here to have to worry about.  Come alone and eat at the bar, or grab a group and push some tables together upstairs, either way, the food here warrants a regular visit",4.0,2,1

"A few months ago, I didn't have the best experience at Noble Pie. The owner reached out to me and listened thoroughly to what was lacking in my experience and how it could have been better. He went above and beyond to make up for it, and it was awesome! We had a brunch pizza that was amaaazing. I feel like I could eat that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  We love Noble Pie and it is nice to know that they love us back! It is one of our favorite date spots when it's my husband and I, and one of our favorite spots when we have the kiddos. The best part about Noble Pie is finding food that isn't  on a normal menu & it's yummy. They have a really great selection of beers on tap & a lot of fun drinks.

"Belovely...not so lovely. 

Ordered two items from Belovely for our wedding - a hand-painted wooden welcome sign and a hand-painted cloth banner. The welcome sign came out quite well. The cloth banner, not so much. It seemed hastily constructed and was essentially on a white bed sheet (!?!). We had requested certain colors to match our decor, and was told that they would not work given the sheet's material/color (but it was a white bed sheet! At the very least we expected a nicer material). The correspondence with the proprietors wasn't very smooth and they seemed inflexible with design. Upon receiving the finished product, we were disappointed. The proprietors were inflexible and refused to recreate the item or offer any kind of refund. They stated that ""we approved the original design"". There's some customer service for you. 

Many people have recommended these folks, but we were quite disappointed. Oh well, lesson learned.",1.0,0,0

"This place is not too bad of a commercialized Italian restaurant. You can get a lot of decent food for a decent value. The desserts are my favorite part - the smore dessert is wicked intense and it would probably take me about 5 sittings to finish it alone. The bar is a cool place to hang before dinner or even on the way out of the mall.

However, our service was seriously sub par - hopefully it was just his first night on the job. I can't remember the last time my meal came out before the salads. And, I am a bit turned off by the density of the tables in the center of the main dining room. As long as your table is on the periphery or upstairs, you'll have a little elbow room.",3.0,1,1
"There is a new Chinese restaurant in the Town Center Plaza that is giving it a go.  I believe it to be an independent restaurant, but has all the standard chain offerings that seem to be pretty popular in the area.  As part of a strip mall, there is plenty of free parking in the lot.  

Inside, they have done a complete makeover of the lobby and small shotgun style dining area.  Warm yellow walls, black and white flooring and wainscoting, and teal benches make for an inviting interior though it was kept rather dimly lit.

I decided to get my order to go and after placing my order and paying, grabbed one of the chairs in the lobby by the window.  I didn't see any wait staff, so I believe you are supposed to grab your own supplies from a counter where you pay if you are going to dine in.  Otherwise, you should have all the napkins, sauces, and plastic utensils inside your to go bag.

I was ordering for dinner, so I selected Egg Drop Soup (thick and yellow, but not much seasoning), crab rangoon (6 in an order and quite crisp with a sweet red sauce), and the peppered steak entree that comes with white rice.  The flavor was mild and okay, but the peppers were cut into too large of chunks to be bite sized and I wasn't supplied a plastic knife (which probably wouldn't have cut the peppers).   Fortunately, I was able to dump it out onto a plate at home and take care of it.  But if you were trying to eat directly from the little white box, you would have some challenge.  My wife sampled my dinner and thought that it was okay, but not anything special other than if you simply wanted a quick Chinese to go dinner.

I will say that the lunch specials are priced at only $5.50 and include fried rice and your choice of an egg roll or crab rangoon.   There are 25 lunch special options listed!

Anyway, the food was good, but nothing unique.  The service was efficient and easy to communicate with.  It's nice to have another option for dining in the area.

"Having been to several CBC locations I am a fan of their burgers and since we were at mall near this location I was looking forward to a great burger here. Overall the food here was ok, burger was good but the fries lacked there usual good flavor that I have come to expect and it wasn't due to a lack of seasoning...time to change the oil in the fryer! 
Service was the downside to the experience. Had a guy on the register who struggled to speak English thus had a hard time taking orders....not just ours, I watched as he had trouble with several customers orders and its not like they have an extensive menu. Unlike other locations we never got asked how we would like our burgers cooked either and although I personally like a med-well or well done burger not everyone does. Several tables needed to be cleaned off, another sign of poor service and not once did I see anyone come out into the cafe to clean any off while we were there. Restrooms weren't filthy but could have used some attention too. 
Don't think I will be back to this location anytime soon given that there are others close by and that is a shame as it is in a great location!",2.0,0,1

"This is the second time we stayed here. We like it because it is a clean, affordable place to stay that is just one block off Bourbon. The other good thing is that it is very centrally located. 

On both our visits, the staff was very friendly and helpful. On this visit, we were not leaving until several hours after checkout so they stored our luggage until we were ready to leave. If you have an early flight into NOLA, they will do the same if your room is not ready when you get there.

We had a deluxe King, which is the cheapest King bedroom. Our bed was a little firm, but I like firm beds. My husband does not. The AC worked well, which is important when you are staying in a hot climate. One complaint I had is that they could use a higher grade of sheets and better pillows. Also, it would be nice to have a mini fridge. 

While I think they could do a little upgrading to the bedding, and maybe re-wallpaper the rooms, we would go there again. It is so convenient, it is clean, and the staff is friendly.",4.0,2,2
"The shredded beef is out-of-this-world. They make it using barria, which most mexican restaurants do not do. This makes the shredded beef extremely flavorful; it's tender and very juicy. The beans and rice here are also dynamite, as are the burritos and tostadas. The tortillas they serve with the meat compliments it well.

I do think that they are behind other mexican restaurants on their chips and salsa. The chips were a little too dry and the salsa could have been better with more cilantro. I also cannot give this place 5 stars because they seemed a little too disorganized with the crowd of people. People were waiting next to people eating, and I could tell it was a little uncomfortable for everyone. The service was good but could have been better. As a successful business, they also need to address their private lots because it is not parking friendly. 

Overall, it is a great experience and I do plan on continue eating here.",4.0,2,2

THINGS TO KNOW:
1) They are prompt, pizza was ready a little ahead of schedule
2) They answer the phone and take orders and everything ended up as we ordered
3) The location is convenient 
4) Staffing is friendly
5) The pizza seemed like quality ingredients, the flavors just were not my cup of tea.

"I've been wanting to try the new Focused Health Blends, so I ordered The Trim Fit. I chose this one in particular because it's the only one without banana (though I'm sure you could ask to omit the banana from the others) and I was looking for something low-sugar. The Trim Fit is a blend of coconut water, spinach, kale, avocado, ginger, lemon, peaches, chia seeds, flax seeds, pea protein, and stevia. It's supposed to be low calorie/carb and high protein. The cashier asked if I wanted  to add unsweetened coconut shavings to it for free, and since I love coconut I said yes. Funny enough, I couldn't taste or feel the coconut at all. I got a little bit of a tingle at the back of my throat from the ginger, and the lemon flavor really came through. It ultimately tasted like a slice of lemon and poppyseed something to me - good stuff! I only wish these Focused Health Blends were offered in a size other than the 16 oz. I would've gone bigger! Can't wait to try a different one.",5.0,2,2
"Geez, from the Yelp reviews I was expecting some fancy yuppie-Mex place, and so I was totally shocked to enter the door and find a taqueria with counter service.  However, they will also take orders from a table if you find you can't study the menu adequately while being jostled in a crowded, noisy line.

This was only a half mile walk from my apartment so I thought I'd give it a try. I got the Burrito Supremo and was not disappointed. I hadn't had anything to eat all day and I could barely eat half (probably had something to do with the amazing chips and salsa but hey that's beside the point). Overall I was very impressed. Food was great, margaritas were strong, and service was comparable to other similar restaurants. Will I be back? I'm sure. But I will try other Mexicán restaurants in the area.

"In theory, the concept of Sun King Spirits sounds great. In execution, my group was not super impressed. The place is set up basically like a food court with four different food windows and open seating. Wait staff come get your drink order at the table, and you walk up to the windows to get food. Two ""restaurants"" are upstairs and two are downstairs. Be prepared to wait in line. They don't bring the food to you. For seating, there are two levels inside and also patio seating options. Tables fill up quickly, so you need to be on alert for when a seat does open up. We weren't able to get a seat in the bar area, and ended up sitting near La Margarita. My seat back was against the line for La Margarita--not ideal. I didn't love having so many people right up in my space while I was trying to relax. Also, be aware, this is a family friendly restaurant, and if you don't get a seat in the bar area you will probably be near some kiddos. I bet we would have enjoyed it more if we were sitting at the bar, or hadn't come so hungry. This is a better place just to grab a drink or a small bite.",3.0,1,0
"Let me put my sad face on while I write this review, which has been (unfortunately) a long time coming. I'd like to point out this review is solely for the Southgate Mall stand-alone location (NOT the one inside of The Bay).

I have been a dedicated MAC customer for years, as in WELL over a decade (although I still try and convince myself I don't look a day over 21). That being said, I have been to literally every MAC location across Edmonton, Calgary, etc. numerous times and normally have absolutely no complaints whatsoever...except for this location. As Southgate is the most convenient/close location for me to visit, it saddens me to say I have had more unfortunate and disappointing experiences than I wish to admit.

No matter the extent of the stores busyness, I am rarely, if ever, greeted/acknowledged or asked if I need assistance. The especially annoying problem with this, on top of the sheer rudeness and lack of customer service, is the fact that at MAC you cannot simply grab most items off of the shelf, an employee must get it for you. With this being said, my visits to this MAC location usually end up with me doing laps around the store/wandering like a lost nomad while praying for assistance so I may get my items and be on my way, or standing in one spot like a creep for 10 achingly-long minutes while desperately vying for an employees attention. Not okay. Especially not okay because most of the employees I have come to clearly recognize over the years (and they would have to recognize me as a frequent/loyal customer by now...you would think) and yet I receive the same lack-luster and severely disappointing service EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

To this I say boo! Boo on you Southgate MAC! I will no longer be a fool to your completely insufficient customer service. How I wish the location inside of The Bay at Southgate had the entire selection of products that your stand-alone location does so I could wistfully bring my business there (as they are much friendlier and willing to help a girl out), but alas they don't carry some of my key items. So it looks like I shall be trekking across the city instead, possibly to West Edmonton Mall or Kingsway just to get some dang service. And hopefully less awkward wandering and gawking moments.",2.0,0,0
"This review is for delivery only...never ate at the restaurant.  

Food came lightening fast...I was starving so the promptness made me instantly happy!  Food was above your standard Chinese delivery fare.  The sauces and vegetables were fresh tasting, not frozeny and/or bottled.  The hubby even said, ""this is good,"" which, for him, is a lot.  I'm a vegetarian, and I had plenty of options.  Awesome - definitely recommend!",5.0,2,2
"I've been going to this Peking since I was a little girl. Every year they get worse. After the old guy (possibly the owner) hung up on my mother because she couldn't understand him, I called back and said that the line must have gotten disconnected. He said, no, he hung up on her.
We haven't been back until today. I called ready to order and that same jerk was taking orders. I was saying the order and he kept cutting me off to ask if I was finished.  When I did finish, he said SO SLOW! SO, I waited for him to repeat my order then I told him that I apologized for talking slowly because I only wanted to make sure he heard everything correctly.
He is ALWAYS rude and terrible. And they give you 1-2 packets of sauce total for family meals.
 I'll keep going to the other Chinese Restaurants, NOT this one. I've never been to a place that was consistently rude to people that were being kind.

"This is the place to go on a first date, business dinner, with your friends...or in some cases, just to try some amazing, culinary gems by yourself.

Fresh, homemade pasta is HERE, no reason to waste time at ""The HIll"" when you can go to Stellina's Pasta Cafe.

I am really impressed.  Having a background and keen knowledge in fine dining cuisine and service, this place is a winner for me.

The menu is lovely...find out for yourself.

The server was great, the bus boy was attentive as he repeatedly & appropriately filled our water glasses.

What separates this facility from the Four Seasons, or The Ritz is its ambiance, not the food.  It is not pretentious, over-elaborate with stuffy decor....instead, it is simple, inviting, and chic.

EAT HERE. SIMPLE.

Not that I REALLY know what crack is like, mind you....but I can't see how it can be any more addicting than this stuff.

Nice selection of flavors, lots of toppings, and the place is always sparkling clean.

I knocked a point off because the staff seems to think everyone is a regular.  On our first time in, we were a little lost, and only one person was working, so we had to wait a while before we could figure out the process.  After the first time, though, you're golden.",4.0,2,2
"I was here from out of state, but used to live in Fl and was so excited to get some fresh sashimi again! The place was packed on a random Tuesday night. I hoped that was a good sign! The sake was good, but the sashimi was just ok. White tuna is my favorite, but it was oddly watery and had no flavor. The service was good, the rest was a bit disappointing. I quickly realized most of the customers were very young adults with lots of cosmetic ""enhancements"".  One near me asked for cheater chopsticks, then a fork. She also said she loves sushi as long as she has teriyaki sauce for dipping. That's like ordering a wagyu filet well done. Made me sad, but the staff was so good about it! It's quite possible the sushi was subpar because they cater to those who don't like sashimi or other fresh sushi. I can't knock them for that, just manage expectations and know what you're going for.",3.0,1,0
"This little diner is a regular slice of contemporary Americana. I always love going to independent restaurants, and this one smacks of small-town charm and honest-to-goodness home-style cooking.

I loves me some biscuit and gravy, and rarely do I find it north of Dixie, especially a good plate of it. The biscuits here were light and fluffy and moist... no hockey pucks here. The sausage gravy ROCKS! Not overly salted, just simply delicious, with a good amount of sausage swimming around, this gravy lavishly coats those amazing biscuits. These are among the best biscuits and gravy I've had up north.

The bacon was perfectly crispy, and a great compliment to my main dish, although I had to order it as a side. The pancakes are light and fluffy, and the french toast is thick and tasty, with just enough of the egg coming through.

I'm generally not a fan of home fries, but the ones here were very good. I asked for them well-done, and that they were, and done well. They had a nice crispness without being burnt. 

The staff is pleasant and the service is prompt. I look forward to coming back for other meals and will follow up when I do.",4.0,2,2

I cannot believe I have not ventured here before.
This place is going to have to go on to my top 5 eateries list in Nashville.
Truly a gem in the restaurant world.

Last night, friends and I went for ""Restaurant Week"" and to say we were enchanted, wouldn't be good enough.
For $30 we were fed like Kings..
Salad, appetizer, main meal, dessert AND two glasses of white wine..

I ordered the Caesar salad which was fresh, but the lettuce was still really wet from being washed..  it watered down the dressing.. But that didn't hinder dinner at all!

I got the salmon with grilled asparagus, wilted greens and I think it was sticky risotto.  Not sure.. I only ate a couple bites of the stuff, BUT the salmon in the coconut curry sauce was phenomenal..  Sweet coconut curry on top of grilled salmon that didn't taste fishy, at all...  crispy edges..  the asparagus was cooked absolutely perfectly. Not tough, not soft, just right! Wilted greens, not over cooked.  I was amazed at the way they treated the food..  really, really impressed.

One friend got the pork tenderloin, with plum sauce and she asked that it be cooked MR and that's exactly how it came out.  
Another friend ordered the lake trout and it completely covered her plate. (she ended up taking half her dinner home)

Dessert:  ooooh my!  Two of us ordered the Bailey's caramel cheesecake and one friend ordered the chocolate cake.

Portions were large (American size), everything was fresh and cooked to order, food came out hot except for the fried green tomatoes.. They were not just fried up..  They weren't really hot.  But they were good, just the same.  When I cut into the tomatoes, they were not juicy like other places... which was fine..  the red pepper mayo they served it with was a good accompaniment. 

All in all, food was fresh, some quirks but it's Restaurant Week and they probably were slammed everyday.

I would definitely go back again to try other goodies on their menu.
Jason was tending the bar and he was efficient, fast, and never let our water glasses go empty.

Great restaurant, great food, everything fresh and cooked (nearly) to order..
Nothing was sent back, portion sizes were large..  Two people with small appetites could share a meal, here.  
The place was packed when we left.
They have a great reputation and I can see why.

Definitely put this on the top 5 eateries for best of Nashville!",5.0,2,2

"Totes one of the coolest gay bars in NOLA. Why, you ask?

Okay, it started off meh when they tried to charge cover, but David K, quite the charmer, talked them into a deal. Not sure what the cover charge was for anyway - there wasn't live music, and there were only two male gogo dancers. 

There's an upstairs area that's more dance club-ish, but there's also balcony seating where you can escape the noise and have a semi-quiet convo. There are multiple restrooms, though I wish the ladies had their own room because no matter what - gay or straight - men still leave the toilet seat up!

Aight, so the good stuff. They play bomb ass music. And a lot of it was 1) stuff I never heard of or 2) stuff I hadn't heard in yeeeaaarrrrs. And to top it all of, there's a giant music video screen behind the main bar where you can watch vids like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEh_asEffoQ and this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gDuGMpClo

The bartender was really cool, he kept complimenting my hair - ""Sir, I know I'm not your type, but go on..."" - and was sure to take care of the ladies first. Best yet? My mom had a good time. It was her first time at a gay bar, and she enjoyed the company, so much that by the end of the night she (bashfully) placed her first dolla bill in the male gogo dancer's hot pants.

"If there were a half star or even zero star review then I would give that. This place is so over hyped I almost think all the reviews are written by their employees. Before I rip this place too hard let me point out that this place is half deli/convenience store and half pizzeria/restaurant...if you wanna call it that. I cant speak for the deli/store part of the place, but the ""restaurant"" on the other hand--The food was TERRIBLE! My gf got a salad and it was basically a bag of lettuce, strips of nasty looking bacon, and a pile of soggy peppers. The dressing isn't even made there or anything remotely fresh...how do I know? Because we asked for dressing and she handed us those little plastic pouches of Kens dressing or whatever the brand is (the ones you get at Wawa). I got a chicken cheesesteak that was so bland and literally had no cheese. I asked for BBQ sauce on it and i barely got a drop. The sandwich was tiny (took about 5 bites to finish). This place is a total let down. Normally I'm not overly picky over cheesesteaks because I know nothing compares to a real one from Philly...but this place shouldn't even call it a cheesesteak. It's pathetic. Ohhhh and not to mention...when we walked in we saw the employees stuffing cookies and food in their face behind the counter while touching other food and handling money. Disgusting. Cooks look like they're 16 years old and the counter girls clearly smoke a pack a day. Sorry Massos but you are the worst place I've reviewed so far.",1.0,0,0

"They are generally pretty picky about what they buy, which bodes well in terms of knowing that we are getting good quality products when we buy from them.

THey LOVE women's denim so I always make some good money when I sell my jeans. Even though they are picky they pay decently for stuff. I usually drop my stuff off with them first because I'll get the most money back if they buy things, then take the rest to Junkee since they pay very little but take some weird stuff, and then the rest goes to Goodwill.

"Geno's is another famous cheesesteak place in Philly and as you may already know it sits right across the street from Pat's.  The difference in this place is that it has underlying tones of racism.  The previous owner was known for retaining an ""American's Only Speak English"" mentality and he made it known with various signs around the restaurant.  He's since passed, and I won't speak ill of the dead, but they've gotten new management, and they've said that the new owner, who happens to be the previous owner's son, does not share any of the controversial views of his father and that they were working to remove the racist undertone from the establishment; however, I have two questions.  

Question #1: Why was my Muslim friend, who has a full grown beard, completely ignored when he was trying to order his food?  Not a ""he's not speaking loud enough"" kind of ignore either, they just blatantly acted like he wasn't there.

Question #2:  Is it really possible to remove a racist undertone from an establishment that has been in place for so long?  Because from recent experience it still seems to linger.  One could also ask does the apple fall far from the tree with regards to the undertone, but I don't know the guy personally so I can't really speak on that.

All in all, I really want to like and enjoy this place as it seems to be a Philadelphian staple; however, it's left a bad taste in my mouth (without having even trying any of their food.)

"Every year we make our way to Peddlers village in the fall. It was always a wish to eat at Buttonwood Grill but until this year we were never able to get in. We put our name in around 11:15 and waited about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. We got a coveted spot on the deck which was perfect on the gorgeous fall day. Our waitress was nice and clearly busy. 

The other adults I was with enjoyed their meals. Maybe I ordered poorly. I started with the fall margarita. It was served in a pint glass which was new to me. It tasted like a non-descript fruit drink, but not like either the apple cider nor cranberry it described. It also had no rim of any kind. I also ordered the southwest salad. It was so pathetic. The second I saw it I thought ""did someone order a plain side salad?"" The dressing was flavorless. It was a bed of chopped romaine lettuce with a sad little quesadilla on top. It promised black beans, corn, tomatoes, and avocado. I literally counted 6 black beans,  1 kernel of corn, and 2 tiny pieces of avocado. It was horrible! I told the waitress to let the chef know it was a crappy salad. And $14 to boot. So disappointing. 

The kids meals we ordered were fine. They described it as a chicken and cheese taco but it was very much a quesadilla. The other adults enjoyed their burger. The fries were decent. We started with the crab and spinach artichoke dip which was, again, pretty flavorless. 

You're definitely paying a high tab for being in such close proximity to Peddler's Village. I would never choose to come back here, but I guess it is promising that some of the other dishes were okay.",3.0,1,2

"TL;DR: Wonderful for lunch and dinner. Don't leave the city without giving them a try.

Long version:
Prior to Katrina, I frequented The Gumbo Shop on and off for close to a decade. I returned earlier this month for the first time in nine years. Naturally, I was a little concerned whether or not the quality declined in my absence. Things change, even in New Orleans (albeit *slowly*).

Well, I'm happy to report that their jambalaya is still exceptional, and we had two wonderful dining experiences there this month (April 2015).

It was my partner's first time to the city, and Jenna (first night, on 4/16) and Kenneth (second night, on 4/19) treated us very, very well.

I asked the greeter (Gerry, I think) if it was possible to wait for a window seat by the Jackson Square mural: a symbolic gesture, since I had my very first meal in the city there in 1995. Not only did she acquiesce, I was shown to the very same seat. There was that ""extra mile"" I've come to know these folks for, even with a brisk dining crowd. :)

I marvel at the Gretna reviewer who said her jambalaya tasted like ""dish water"". Ours was *exceptional*, much as it has always been. Again, I was on guard against quality decline in a post-Katrina era. None of our items tasted ""prepped"" or not fresh. Quite the opposite. Not sure happened with her meal, but I feel bad for anyone denied the experiences we enjoyed there.

As per tradition, I opened with my usual cup of chicken andouille gumbo, followed by jambalaya for the main dish. My partner had jambalaya for her first visit and the Creole combination platter for her second. She loved them both. We shared a bowl of the bread pudding, which I highly recommend if you have the room to spare.

It's worth noting that both of our servers made us feel very much at ease with our pace of conversation and time to close out our check. To the reviewer who felt ""rushed"", I can only say that is not the norm of the restaurant *I* have come to know and love over the years. Management-willing, it will stay that way.

Again, thanks for the delicious food as well as the genuinely warm service from Jenna, Kenneth and our friendly greeter. We'll be back.",5.0,2,0

"Right on the beach and a great place even on chilly nights without live music! 

We went when it was dark and cool outside and arrived at about 7:00. We were informed immediately that their last call for food and drinks was 8:00pm. I'm not exactly sure if this is due to Covid or if it's just their weekly hours? It was also Monday...

You do have to pay for parking! 


The place was decorated so cute with Xmas lights! There's seating to block any wind on the inside, seating right on the beach and outdoor bar spots as well. 

Our server was very good! Probably the best since we've been living here. Very tentative and friendly. 

My husband ordered the cheeseburger, my son ordered wings (bbq) and I ordered the Crab Cake dinner. Wings were so good! Very sweet.

My crab cakes were incredible. A ton of crab meat and a generous portion compared to other places( but then there's no such things as too much crab cake, right?!) 

We've been eating out a LOT and I'm trying to keep it on the lighter side. My side was grilled seasoned vegetables and a side salad. The only side options they offer are kettle chips, pasta salad, mashed potatoes but I was able to upgrade to a side salad for $1.50.

At home I found that the light did not fit my hood because it is actually around 30"", not 36"".  I returned to the store to exchange the light. They still have them in the wrong spot. This is literally the worst pet store I have shopped at and I will never return. The employees are incompetent. I found that the one remaining 36"" light did not have a 36"" light in the box. I asked the employee at the register and she was of no help. She went to get the manager who told me I'll need to call the manufacturer to find out why their 36"" lights are shorter than 36"". Perhaps she could learn more about the products in her store or at least attempt to help a customers find a resolution. I will never spend a dollar at the Antioch location again.

"Large restaurant with multiple booths and comfortable seating. Quick turnaround of tables so barely any wait. Clean restrooms. Friendly staff and excellent customer service with a smile. Amazing menu with multiple options. And they have a plethora of Dessert options!! I ordered the crab bake Benedict and it was delish! Basically all Crab and barely any breading!! You can see the chucks of real crab meat. Loved it! My dad ordered the waffle and it just melts in your mouth, so soft and fluffy. My mom got a slice of cheese cake, so moist and all cheesecake, no crust. Made with real strawberries you can see. They have small ones you can order to take home. Overall very warm and homey place.

"We were at Malt House Cellar for a party the other night.  It's a nice, open space.  I think they even provided a mic for some words from our host.  Pool, fusbol, and darts provided fun ways to enjoy the evening.  The bartender was great and willing to try a new concoction I ordered.  The food they served was also paleo, in keeping with the eating habits of most of our party.
There seemed to be a somewhat odd arrangement of renting the space for two hours.  It seems like the drinks purchased would have more than covered the overhead for keeping the room open but perhaps staff costs had to be factored into that and it might not have made fiscal sense.
FYI, it was a cash only bar the night we were there so best to come with cash.",3.0,1,2
"I like it, the vibe inside is cozy and inviting with distressed wood and natural colors.  I can't say I'm a huge fan of the short stools in the dining room, not very comfortable, so I'll probably stick with the bar moving forward.  The beer selection is very good and I like how they list the ""on deck"" brews to keep people coming back.  

My only real downside, which I notice seems to be a trend from the other reviews, is that they were out of the meatloaf sandwich when I dined (at 7:00, really?)  Kind of a bummer when you'd looked at the menu earlier in the day, decided upon making the walk across town, only to find out the one thing you'd had your mind set on was 86'd.  Bummer indeed.  

Even still, we decided to split the burger which was cooked perfectly medium rare and the onion poppy bun was perfect, fresh and flavorful, holding up nicely to the condiments.  The fries were also very good, perfectly cooked, and a very good portion.  The burgers come with fries (with a $1.50 sub for a side salad) while the sandwiches come with a side salad (with a $1.50 sub for fries.)  Not sure the reasoning here, but it pushed us towards the burger as a chicken sandwich and fries would have been $14.50 as opposed to the burger with fries at $11.  So a very good value for a very tasty burger.  We also had the short rib macaroni & cheese which was very good and a nice portion - not so much you couldn't finish (or feel terrible after) or too little that it was a rip-off.

I look forward to returning and hopefully I can taste the meatloaf sandwich soon.  I mean, I understand how they could run out, it reads the best of anything on the menu (dry aged beef, bacon onion relish, roasted tomato, pan gravy, french fries, fried egg, onion poppy roll) - see, who wouldn't want that?!  Even still, it bums me out to no end when restaurants are out of something that's on their standard menu.",4.0,2,1

Lots of customers, lots of servers, but some of them did not seem to know what was going on.  Our meals didn't come out at the same time, so we had to ask about it. At that time, the one server explained he had collided with somebody else in the back and a new sandwich was being made. Why wouldn't someone have simply explained that? Lots of potential here, but better communication with the customers and amongst themselves is needed.",3.0,1,1

I was reassured my car would be ready the next day. Once again no call. I called an hour before close and they told me the tech was gone for the day and my car was not ready.

"This place has been here for YEARS. My cousin used to work at the salon next door; but I'd never been in. Tonight, we ordered takeout; appetizer sampler, egg drop soup, shrimp w/lobster sauce, & my husband had the General Tso's chicken. My son ordered a strawberry boba. 

Now let me just say, I'm picky about Chinese food. I grew up eating it, & there aren't too many places that I'm happy with. When I ordered, they told me 20 minutes; I live 18 minutes away, & when I arrived my order was packaged & ready to go. The soup was served in a reusable plastic container, and there was plenty of sweet n'sour & soy sauce. 

The first thing I noticed was how neat & clean everything was; tempura, egg rolls, & crab puffs we ordered were all crisp - not oily or greasy AT ALL. Normally crab puffs are all cream cheese, but these had bits of krab throughout. Everything had a TON of flavor, was served with generous portions, and tasted fresh. The sauces were used sparingly, & were light & flavorful, not overly sticky & thick. They have a LOT of choices to support ANY diet, & most dishes come w/vegetarian options. We were pleased to find that both dishes were served w/plenty of fresh veggies, & nothing was overcooked. 

We left the table totally stuffed, & we definitely still have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow! I think I just found my new Chinese place!",5.0,2,2

"I was stuck between a 2 and 3 stars but I don't want to be too mean. In summary, this was an OVER PRICED and LACKLUSTER meal. 

My boyfriend and I made a spontaneous decision to go here for dinner on a Tuesday night since he came here once and wanted me to try it. Our favorite Mexican food staple is Taco Riendo a couple blocks down from here. This restaurant is very small, less than 10 tables and about 3 are near the door, then the closest table is about 10ft from the kitchen. It's a cozy little restaurant with dark lightning but definitely not a classy vibe. Btw it's BYOB. 

The waitress was very nice and kept checking up on us, service wasn't bad although she was a bit antsy and awkward with conversation lol. Food came out fast, but we were one of two tables there, and the other table already got their food, so I can't really judge on how fast they'll be if they're Busier. Here's where everything goes downhill.
 
The table came with free chips and salsa to dip. However, I didn't enjoy the chips at all. They were way too crispy, thin, and had absolutely no flavor, tasted stale almost. I felt as if I was biting on shards. I was very disappointed and waited for the chips that came with the $9 guacamole hoping it'll be better. To my surprise, the guacamole came out ALONE, probably about 6-7 spoonfuls of guac and NO chips. $9!!!!!! Ok at this point I'm expecting banging guac and honestly, this was also very mediocre. I've had better packaged guac from Trader Joe's -.- we also decided to share one Mexican corn, which was $5.5 for a small one. The Mexican corn was mostly sweet, there wasn't really the spicy, sweet, and sour kick I was looking for. At half the price at Taco Riendo, you get a bigger corn that tastes way better!

I am a sucker for platters and I decided on the pork shoulder platter which came with a handful of pork (shredded, and super soft), re fried beans, a tiny bit of rice, and half a plantain. I loved the plantain, but it was so small, there was soooo much meat compared to the rice and the meat was a little too salty to be eating alone. There was like 3 bites of rice before it was gone. $17. Would I get it again? Probably not. Unproportional, overpriced, and mediocre food.

My bf got the beef tacos and the al pastor tacos; tacos are probably the only thing on the menu that isn't overpriced. However, the taste of these tacos were also mediocre at best, nothing really stood out about them. The sauces weren't good, meat wasn't too flavorful, and the condiments didn't help. 

Our total was almost $60 and a good way to put it is that meal did not ""hit the spot."" I was left feeling empty inside although I was so full. Maybe they were having an off day in the kitchen but the food was so bad. Won't be back :(",3.0,1,0

"My friends and I stopped by here to grab something lightish to eat after we played The Escape Room in KOP. We knew it would be crowded, but fortunately, they had a large table that was reserved for another group for later on. We were able to take that table, but had about a little over an hour to eat; which was more than fine and enough time. The employees were all helpful despite how busy the restaurant was. We each ordered something to we can share. I cannot say their food was impressive, but wasn't bad. Some dishes were a bit too salty, and appetizers like mussels were a bit undercooked and not enough flavour. However, the highlight and my favourite was their loaf of bread! Just a word of caution, we ordered two orders of mussels, and didn't realize each of the order came with a loaf of bread. Because we also ordered a bread plate to share, so we had three loaves ... Just wished the waitress told us this when we were ordering, but the bread was so good we didn't complain 

I would like to go back when it's not too crowded and try their other entrees to see if it's any different. I heard that their brunch buffet is amazing so I would definitely like to try that. Overall, a good experience, and want to give another opportunity to try.",4.0,2,2

The real problem was that you just weren't taken care of that well unless you were a regular.  Waiter ignored us for the most part.  We got the less desirable table.

"Being born and raised in France, you know I had to try this place.
The place is small with a few tables inside and outside. I immediately saw some things in the display case that I haven't seen anywhere other than in France, which made me hopeful. A young man took our order to find out he was the owners son, and yes, they are all actually from France.
We opted for the Croque Monsieur and the plate of charcuterie.

That Croque Monsieur was HUGE for $5 (more on that later). The taste....what can I say....other than I'm drooling writing this review thinking about it. You can tell the ham and cheese they used was definitely not the cheap stuff. But it's $5!!!!! How can that be????

The charcuterie was very French. Again, you definitely can tell the cheese and meats were imported and not something you can find at a local grocery store, no matter how nice the store is. WOW!!!! (Drooling even more now, thanks a lot!!!).

Couldn't leave without tasting some pastry. Pain au chocolat, and have to try the chocolate mousse (do you see a pattern here? Yes, I'm a chocolaholic, and fell off the wagon. STOP JUDGING ME!!! LOL).
The pastry was amazing, and the mousse was thick yet light and so FREAKING good! (Am I going to ever stop drooling? I got to end this review. I'm getting weird looks).

Talked to the owner. Super nice! He showed me around, and the crates with the cheeses he orders (yep! Imported), and said he was frustrated with French restaurants being so expensive everywhere, and wanted to show what normal French people eat, as most can't afford a $100+ meal.
Aaaahhhh, that explains the prices. Wow! I have a lot of respect for these people!

"Pretty in Pink.  A five star review for Pacific Counter is a no-brainer!  The service is almost overwhelming (there are so many people ready to make whatever you want -- and they are all so positive and happy to help). 

A friend was in town who had never eaten a Poke bowl -- I know! It's hard to believe those people still exist.  I had net yet tried Pacific Counter.  
It was destined to be.  

We stopped in this Central Ave newby and quickly figured out the approach.  He selected a house signature bowl, I opted to build my own.  

When I mentioned the positivity - that comes in the form of praise for all the good choices you make when assembling the bowl.  The cashier heaped the admiration for my beautiful bowl on me as if I had crafted it myself. 

Along the wall is a nice selection on non-carbonated drinks including some funky fruity tea combinations which fit the pink motif to a tee.

I sure wish that serving of salmon were bigger....but the price was very reasonable.  Some other folks tried the pizzas which looked beautiful.  The veggie sandwich was a particular hit with my colleague...even served with homemade chips.

They put me with a salesman named Austin who was extremely nice and very professional. He made the whole thing actually enjoyable. The GM and finance manager were awesome as well. Everyone made me feel very comfortable, which is tough when you're buying a car. I think what I can appreciate most about this dealership is that they were very transparent and eager to send me home with a new car that I was happy with. Instead of just selling me on a car that just looked pretty, they educated me as well, which the other dealership didn't. I could not be any happier with my 2018 Honda Civic turbocharged Ex-t!!

Tried some Shu Toro and Uni too all up to Chef Nick Bognar's standards well known now from Nippon Tei. Hey we know Nick knows sushi right? What is really great here are all the small plates and I have not even ventured into the shared larger dishes (like Dungeness Crab Rice!). There are some hot small plates, and some cold. The green beans are vegan, with a vegan XO sauce-paste, stir fried beans in a blackened garlic, and they may be the tastiest thing we had. Unbelievable!  Lamb Larb will appeal to some and not others. Basically a lamb tartar. Super fresh, well prepared and very mild in flavor. The cooked lamb ribs were so soft while still retaining a sear and coupled with a wonderful sauce. Awesome. Even Japanese Eggplant was terrific. What could be done new there? Well he did something new and it tasted great. Drier, not much of a sauce, but flavored perfectly. Finally, we tried Shrimp Toast, not at all what you might remember of shrimp toast. A darker bread base form a local bakery topped with a lot of things. There is a lot going on here flavor wise yet the shrimp flavor still comes through clearly. I liked it. Some might find it complex but it is tasty.  We also tried the Shikoku 75 and the Enchante house cocktails. We do not usually order house cocktails but they are sort of a thing here and we ordered seconds! No wine or sake needed but a nice selection nonetheless. Joss was our server and a real credit to the restaurant with all of the knowledge and passion for the menu you could desire.  We will update after our second visit. But you can be assured that this is a great addition to the town's culinary attractions, and well worth multiple visits. Chef Nick has brought together a menu that speaks of him and his life and experiences, which is what he wanted to do.  Its a job well done.",5.0,2,2
YUM! Mac n cheese is unreal. Breadcrumbs make it a must have. We also got the spinach artichoke dip and smoked trout dip which were both incredible. So so so good!!!! Love this place,5.0,2,2
"This is the best Indian restaurant we have come across in the US, so far. The food is absolutely amazing. The ambiance is great and the gentleman at the counter is very friendly. 

Food: 
We tried Aloo Chat for the appetizer, Roti (Flatbread), Eggplant Masala, Basmati Rice and Yellow Daal for the main course and finished the meal with a hot tea. To begin with, Aloo Chaat is great - not much sour-spicy but just right enough for you to enjoy. Eggplant Masala is delicious, especially the gravy was very well made. The amount of acidity in the gravy made it very appetizing. However, what blew my mind was the Yellow Daal. Quite thick and absolutely delicious. I am not completely sure or recall what spices went into that but it was one of the best, I have had till date. Definitely to be tried. While the food was absolutely delicious, I thought to do a final litmus test - TEA. And unfortunately, the tea doesn't live up to the expectations set by the food. I liked the tea but nothing outstanding about it. 
What is peculiar along with the food is the serving bowls and plates, which I believe is typical of Pakistan, and gives a very authentic feel to the meal.  

Ambiance:
The restaurant has a very welcoming feel vibrant color walls and open space providing a good breathing space. The variety in term of seating options is great. There are sofas, regular table-chairs and then there is a section with a large table and cushion benches for large groups. There are other things like a carrom board and a TT table if you just feel like relaxing while your meal is being prepared. There is a TV which plays great music. 

Staff:
Well, in terms of staff, you would meet just this one gentleman who handles everything - from taking orders to serving food, with the entire team of chefs behind the counter. Very friendly person and always attempting to lighten up the mood. The service was pretty good - not so quick, but for the quality of food that they serve, every second is worth the wait. The payment is very convenient and you get the receipt on your email ID itself, so you don't have to worry about that. 
 
Overall, a great restaurant, definitely serving one of the best Indian food in the country. This is one place for which I can drive down to Indianapolis from Cincinnati. 

One point on location of the restaurant:
If you are using Google Maps to navigate, it shows a weird way of reaching to this place, which is driving down to Lafayette Road from exit 121 to West 52nd Street to West 53rd Street to Moller Road and back to West 52nd Street to  Lafayette Street and then to the plaza in which the restaurant is located. Not sure why this happens. So, you can just keep a watch towards your left after Exit 121 and take a U-turn as you cross the plaza where this restaurant is located.

REVIEW #2:
So, this time, we were on our way to Cincinnati from St Louis and it was evening, so we opted for Chapati as our dinner destination before heading for a two-hour drive back home. 

With rainy and cold weather freezing us out, what could get better than a plate of Pakoras and Hot Chai. For the main course, we ordered Aloo Tarkari and Chapati. Just like the last time, the food was delicious, especially the Onion Pakoras. However, the mess up happened when everything came together. Ironically, the Chai was the last to come. So, by the time we finished Pakoras and Chai, the Aloo Tarkari was dead-cold. We had to send it for reheating but if one knows the Indian cuisine, reheating doesn't go that well and within a minute or two of it coming back, it was cold again. 

Maybe we did not specifically mention that the chapati and Aloo Tarkari should come later on because it is logical. However, I realized that restaurants in the US have this habit. In the entire US, it was only Aladdin Eatery in Cincinnati, that we were asked by the waiter that we should get entrée after the appetizer.",4.0,2,2
"Not a fan of Hard Rock franchise and this visit reaffirms that status.  Stopped in because they had the Giants game on.  We each had a burger (Fiesta, pretty good and cooked at a perfect medium) and a Bloody Mary, which was blah. Ordered the seasonal veg (broccoli, just about raw and inedible) in place of fries.  Place is so loud is hard to think,  let alone talk.  Serve was nice but sightings of her became more and more rare as time went on.  Tab for the above - $52 and change.

"We tried their Saturday family meal for 4 tonight. We chose the chicken fajitas for $25. I couldn't believe how much food was included. 

Chicken, with sauteed peppers and onions, rice, beans, sour cream, cotija cheese, guacamole. Pico de gallo was supposed to be included but we didnt receive which was fine bc the entire meal was $25. The included guac and cotija were in small amounts but for $25 we couldn't ask for more and I would be willing to pay for more cotija and more guacamole next time. We even had food leftover and we are 4 adults who were eating. 

That's a better price than I could cook the same meal with all the separate ingredients myself.  The food was also delicious. 

You can also get beer in bottles and growlers as take out which is nice for next time.  We will definitely eat here again, and once restrictions on eating in restaurants are eased, I will eat here in person as well.",5.0,2,2
Did you know that the original owners son was partly responsible for the attacks in Mumbai? He was apparently this huge heroin smuggler/terrorist... This place is old school old city. I remember going to the khyber back when terrible(some amazing) bands were playing over at upstairs at nicks. I remember when we would go to the khyber before there was a northern liberties and when old city was really kind of a ghetto. Gosh the good ol days before all the hipsters before all the brightly colored bikes and I'm too cool for school rejects. I remember a time when most of these little shits roaming the city would've had to have a whole bunch of extra diapers in their coach messenger bags to be hanging round this place. I'm talking about a time when nirvana was playing songs off bleach at j.c. Dobbs or fugazi at the khyber. on south street and the fanciest beer on draft was the one that worked. I saw so many bands here and I am afraid that shangri la is dead. I gave this five stars only based on nostalgia.,5.0,2,2

"Four Green Fields is one of my favorite Tampa establishments. I love all things Irish and this place just happens to be as authentic as they come. On weekends they have live Irish music and it is the real deal. I could sit there all night listening to their music.

The Guinness tastes different then any other bar's in the US. The bartenders are actually from Ireland too so they know their stuff!

The food is as good as it gets... I love the Shepard's Pie, the beef stew, the fish and chips and the fries with Guinness gravy.

This is an epic spot to bring some out of towners.",5.0,2,2

"I'm giving Duel Piano Bar a five star review based on where you would go in search of a place providing entertainment, great specials, friendly employees, and a relaxed sports bar feel. Duel provides all of this and it never fails to satisfy me every time I go.

Thursday nights are my favorite night there, partially because of the great specials, but also because it ranges in how busy it gets. Sometimes it's slow/steady and it gives me time to actually relax (which by Thursday is much needed). Other times it slowly gets rowdy around 11 PM, and that's when I wake up and realize, ""Hey, it's Friday tomorrow? What the hell!""

Considering how often I go, it is odd that I have yet to try the food, but then again that's not what I go there for. The piano players I usually see are extremely talented and have a great sense of humor. Their communication with the crowd is what stirs the fun, and they are not shy to embarrass, poke fun, or compliment any patron. Although it's all in good fun, don't go if you're easily offended!

Sincerely,
The Piano Bar Lover",5.0,2,2

I ate at Piccadilly tonight with 2 other people. We had all been here before but not recently. I ordered the chicken pot pie. It was good. They both ordered the fish sandwich with fries. Neither of them liked it. They both said that there was almost no fish and way too much breading. On our way out of the building we heard another man making the exact same comment.

"We recently ordered new carpet flooring from Yeager after our home flooded. Mike was extremely friendly to work with in the store and even came out to our home with samples to help us match the new carpet to some of our older flooring. There was a slight hiccup with the manufacturer shipping our carpet late (something Yeager could not control) and instead of pushing back our install date Jim Yeager went way above and beyond, sending one of his guys way out of town to pickup our carpet and bring it back so it could be installed as scheduled. The installers were on-time, very friendly/professional and paid great attention to detail. It was a drastically different experience compared to what we saw when replacing carpet with a different company 3 years ago. They've earned themselves a customer for life!

"It works well most of the time, and costs less than cable; that's why I stay with them. When there is a problem, their 24x7 ""internet technical support chat"" is available, but more times than not, the agents don't know what they are doing. They are overseas. They don't know how to troubleshoot. They read from a script. I say I have a wired-only connection, and they want me to change wireless settings. I had one agent ask me for my password. Really?

I have 40mbps DSL service, but DSL connects at 34-35mbps and Internet speed at 32-33mpbs. In the fine print, they say that your ""download speeds will be up to 15% lower due to network requirements"". This fine print is available only once during the online purchase process (if you search for it) and also on the confirmation paperwork (in small print). Why not be upfront about it? Better yet, since they already know that their DSL speed will be 15% less and Internet speed 20% less, why not advertise DSL speed at 35mbps? Then they wouldn't need the fine print, and customers won't be dissatisfied. When I contacted CenturyLink chat, they told me that 80% of the advertised speed is good enough. So, if I paid 80% of my $55 monthly bill, would that be good enough for them?

I have heard bad things about CableOne, so I have no desire to switch to them. There is little competition in my area. I'm hoping that Google Fiber will come to my area, but that may not happen in my lifetime. The only other suggestion is for the City of Boise to create a new city-owned utility for municipal broadband internet. The city of Longmont in Colorado did it successfully, and so have other cities.

"Pretty great location for PHL.  Walking distance to everything we needed to go to for business.  Rooms were funky shapes.  I had an ""upgrade"" to a corner room with odd windows.  Only problem is that they put me next to the elevator and my diamond profile specifically mentions my preference of AWAY from elevators.  Ugh, 1st world problems I know, but still.   If you want to be an elite property you need to respect your top visitors wishes.

Executive lounge was pretty much empty - no waters, barely any Diet Cokes.

I love going here. It's the Food Gal and my go-to spot. 

Watching a Phils game and want to loaf around, imbibe a little while watching the best team of our lifetime? Luck's is the spot. 

Looking to swill in a bottomless glass on your own without being disturbed? Pull up a chair and talk to Faith or Clark. Or just be anti-social and drink yourself under the table. 

Late nite with a group of friends? Skip the POPE- go to Lucky's. The back is a great spot for just holing up with a few besties, drinking your fill and being a loud dumbass. 

Want a bite after work? Lucky's has some damn good food. Love the mac n cheese and deconstructed meatball. The cheese is mild, the penne is delic, and the breadcrumbs crunchy.

My boyfriend was offered a free beer to compensate for the mistake, he didn't want alcohol so they have him a pop. When we finally got the pizza and garlic knots, we still were not impressed. The sauce for the knots was a tomato sauce that had a weird taste with the garlic, but the knots were dry so it needed a sauce, ranch would have been better. The pizza was average. Absolutely nothing special, not even flavored crust. Maybe we have different standards for our pizza in Detroit than in Nashville. That was about $22 and a lot of time wasted for us.",1.0,0,0

"Stone Creek is upscale casual dining, I'm sure very popular in the Indy burbs. It's across the street from a movie theater to give you some idea. (Think Clyde's for DCers).

Very interesting interior, a credit to the place, youthful elegance. Spacious. Excellent restroom. And, Stone Creek has even more going for it. Wonderful complimentary bread, truly some of the best I've had at a casual dining establishment. The best deal is the salad. Ordered the seven greens salad, SC's take on the ever popular cranberry/blue cheese/arugula salad that is a staple at these restaurants. Very good. Not soaked in a super sweet viniagrette, ample cheese. They remember that a salad should taste like a salad, not dessert. Large, filling portion. Then I had the corn chowder. Ooo. Not good. Horribly oversalted. Started just fine, but I don't know if by accident or purpose, all that could be tasted by the fourth bite was salt.  

Service was professional, courteous and efficient. 

Final thoughts pertain to the location. This is an odd little outdoor mall, surrounded by a vast parking lot that serves as a moat. It's like the strip mall behind the strip mall. Nice in every way, but this mall epitomizes the consequence of the absence of urban planning. Plainfield, hard hit by the housing crisis, needs to carefully think how to proceed into the future. It's a shame that not just a decent restaurant, but a decent mall is left to languish on the very fringe of unsustainable sprawling exurbia rather than thrive in a deliberately planned neighborhood and city as it ought.",3.0,1,2

He was like well we have a wedding Monday so what do you want exactly? I said well I could do Tuesday because it needs to be delivered. He instantly said THAT IS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE...NOT JUST SOME $9 fee. 

I told him it was fine never mind and just left. I was with my friend that day, and honestly we were both really shocked by the whole thing. I was prepared to spend over $250 for two arrangements and whatever it would cost me to deliver. I was dressed in sweat pants and a hoodie, and I look really young, but I am a professional woman. I drive a 435 BMW, and I own my own business. He didn't see me park, and he knew nothing about me, but I am pretty sure he judged me instantly by the way he looked at me and spoke to me. He was not the tall man that usually works there. He was shorter, and there was a woman working with him.

The rim crust was perfect but the bottom crust was a bit soft in most places, and crispy only towards outter rim. I really didn't care for the Cappy's pizza, thought it was missing a little umph. It wasn't bad but just average. For $22 large ""average"" pizza, I don't plan to return for that. This pizzeria only offers three types of pizza (Cappy's, veggie and cheese) on 2 styles (New York or Chicago). You can add toppings for about $1.80 each also.

"Came here for a child's birthday on a Saturday afternoon. Since the location is in West Edmonton Mall, I'd highly suggest coming earlier as parking on weekends can be a nightmare. I like the renovations I've seen since I was here in 2000s. The kingpin bowling lanes are perfect for little kid parties with lots of seating and low hanging coatracks. Plus the benches and tables have space underneath to store shoes and personal items. The lanes also have the option of guards on the gutter areas so your kid has better odds of bowling pins down, not to mention the animal shaped bowling guides are adorable. Party pricing varies depending on needs but starts at $85 for 1 hour with 7 kids and goes up from there. 
There's a pretty large futuristic lounging area with sofas and foosball tables and nearby arcade to chill out at before or after the party. Further inside is the more grown up 10 pin bowling lanes with larger bowling balls and the washroom area. They have some pretty interesting weekday specials I might have to take advantage of!

On top of that, they also sell their specialty, various kinds of sausages, meat, pickles, and even their own BBQ sauce packaged in a bottle ready for you to smother on your favorite meat in your own comfort home. The store and the surrounding parking area are all smoked up with the irresistible whiff. This pop and pop place is sure going to be my future spot to get my deli meat. 

Now, let's talk sandwich.  Sandwiches are all about good bread, good meat, and fresh crispy greens and let me tell you the sausage shop blows Beyond Bread away.  It's just a locally own small meat shop that sells awesome deli products. The sausage shop is humble.  They may not win the popularity contest but they sure as hell deserve some recognition. 

So here is my 5-star to another Tucson's hidden gem.",5.0,2,2
"I was really impressed by this place. I got a gel manicure and regular pedicure for $45, and was in and out in about an hour. A little seedy from the outside for sure -- my cabbie even questioned if I really wanted to get out there -- but very clean and tidy on the inside. 

The woman who did my nails was a perfectionist.  You would be happy if your brain surgeon showed her attention to detail and the pride she took in doing excellent work.  She double and tripled checked everything, from the filing, and cuticle trimming to the final top coats.  She even chastised me gently for not doing a thorough enough wash of my nails -- apparently it affects how the gel manicure goes on. 

I usually go to the nail salon on Spruce street close to campus, but I think I have find my new midday work break.  I highly recommend this place.",5.0,2,2

"What a gem! 


Some friends and I wandered into the Oyster Bar last Saturday night upon the suggestion of another ""foodie"" friend of ours. We were told that they had authentic Poor Boys (a favorite of mine) and some really good creole dishes.

The place looked great. I felt like I had wandered into a bar right off Bourbon Street. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table since they were pretty busy so we decided to have some drinks while we waited. I was a little surprised that the bartender inside the bar was so unpleasant. They have a sign that says ""Leave your attitude at home"" and yet the bartender looked like she was mad at the world. Fortunately, the rest of the staff was very nice and made our experience really great.

The food was awesome! I had a shrimp Poor Boy and not only was it delicious, but there were so many shrimp that they were falling out of the sandwich. All of our meals were good portions and excellent flavor. I will not only recommend the Broadway Oyster Bar to my friends, but I can't wait to come back myself.",4.0,2,2

"My husband and I came in for our first couples massage..we had no idea what to expect! And let me tell you it was a wonderful experience,
From the moment we walked in we felt very welcomed, it was instantly a calming atmosphere.
They took us into separate rooms to talk to us individually to see what areas we felt needed work and just to get to know us a little better before starting.
Once we were in the room it was so calming with soothing with the music and aromatherapy.
They are extremely professional and made us feel very comfortable. It was the best gift my husband could have got us for our anniversary! 
Once we were done they expand to us what areas we needed work on if ever we returned, I like that they will keep a file on us and what we need for when we go back..
Very highly recommend!",5.0,2,2

"This dental office should most definitely have more reviews than they do because they are simply amazing. 

I have only lived in Nashville a few short months and went to a dentist near my home which I did not like. So, I started asking around for a dentist in the area and Germantown Dental came HIGHLY recommended! I decided to give them a try since they came with such high recommendations and I needed that because I am typically scared of the dentist. 

This was the BEST dental experience I have ever had. The office is in a quaint neighborhood and has such character inside. The check in process was easy and quick. Jessica did my cleaning and let me tell you she has the most gentle approach! I will forever see her! I could not even tell she was doing the cleaning that is how gentle she was. Looked in the mirror though and sure enough you could see a huge difference. 

The dentist himself was very friendly and had an incredible bedside manner. He made me feel comfortable and explained everything in detail in such a way to make sure I understood. He referred me to an oral surgeon and walked me through the pros and cons from his point of view and helped talked me through the fears I have of going. 

If you are looking for a dental office anywhere in the Nashville area - I assure you THIS IS THE PLACE!!!! Thank you Germantown Dental!!!",5.0,2,2

"False advertising & shady business!! I was about to find other accommodations when I saw a piece of paper taped to the pool gate. After the young man at the front desk assured us we could use it I agreed to put my credit card down. The WIFI did not work in our room and was only somewhat accessible by the pool. My colleague had to use my cell as a hotspot to get some work done but couldn't make or receive calls. An old angry man called our room at 9am demanding that we leave immediately because we broke the rules by going to the pool. He yelled at and insulted us for about 20min from behind the front desk then refused to process our refund until after he checked guest in. When I told him I would be posting a negative review about the way he conducts his business he said ""fine you go ahead and do that"" as if he has had people say that to him many times before. I waited outside for another 10min then we left after we got our receipts for our refund. The total charge still processed a few days later so I'm disputing it with my credit card company.

"I tried to be positive about her after my first appointment, although the, um, ""thoroughness"" of her exam left me a little terrified. After leaving, I realized that she didn't ask me if I had any questions. I waited an hour and a half to be rushed through a 10 minute appointment. She was very condescending and made me feel very on edge.

But still, I tried to remain positive. Of course, after the fact I read Yelp reviews and realized I should have looked elsewhere for a new doctor. I just received the message on the patient portal that I needed to schedule a follow up, which of course gave me a heart attack. I then read reviews and realized that this may just be her giving me my results in person to get more money. I called to schedule, and she is out of the office until the 31st. I voiced my displeasure to the receptionist, who very quietly told me she does this all the time and it's very frustrating that she can't just call. The note in my file said to schedule the follow up within 0-2 weeks, so the receptionist assured me that I shouldn't worry about it being urgent.

A great selection of books on health & sexuality, a small section of DVD rentals including both instructional videos as well as porn.  Goodie chests and boxes to store your favorite toys safely from prying roommates. I've heard about the Tickle Trunk party and although it sounds great for women, I think it's a really cool idea!

A top notch collection of lubes, condoms and guy toys (though come on, really? those guy toys just are gross).  What stands out though is the clean and non-dingy feel this store has.

The nuggets: it's obvious that they've sat at the restaurant for at least a couple of hours. They were cold and rubbery. It almost tasted fake. I ate half of one and threw the rest away. 

Fries: super stale and had no salt though.
Again, I'm sure that due to the time of order I also got fries that have been sitting around all day. I love fries and I really wanted it so I forced it but it was bad. Asparagus like and old.

"Had some very bad service here. For a slightly expensive restaurant, my expectation is always service that goes above and beyond. This was no where even close to what I might get from a 16 year old stoner kid at applebees. In fact it was much worse. 

First... we waited 20 minutes for a reserved table. Then they finally sat 8 of us at a small round table meant for 4 at the very front of the room next to the bathrooms and kitchen entrance (aka worst table in the restaurant). Our server was a complete dick. He made several huge mistakes. 1 - initially only took drink orders for half the table, then walked away. 10 minutes later he came back and asked if we had any questions about the menu and I said how about take the rest of our drink orders... no apology. He hated me from that moment on. Also didn't fill my beer up all the way when he brought it out (really?!?!) 2 - brought out the wrong appetizer. 3 - brought out the wrong pasta entree for a vegetarian who hadn't eaten meat in decades and accidentally ate it this night (thanks dumb ass!) 4 - didn't bring us bread until after our salads were finished and we had to ask about it 5 - never apologized for anything never offered anything free, and had a completely awful attitude.

My favorites were the empanadas which were insanely 5+ stars good, the Woodstock pizza and the wings. I've been here several times and this was probably my best meal yet.

"This local pizza shop is affordable and fast. But also know that you get what you get for the price. Their speciality is the pizza, and they come in different sizes, starting from the 8 inch pie, probably the size if you're eating by yourself. In addition to three types of specialty ones, you can choose your own toppings, divided into meats and veggies.

The pizza
1) the dough is pretty good. Nicely flavored and not chewy
2) the sauce is not the best. it needs that more kick or tartness that comes from the tomato sauce. unimpressed
3) skimpy on the cheese

We also had cheesy garlic bread. Not my personal favorite because I like them crispy.

There is hardly any seating, so it's more of a takeout joint. They also offer a 10% student discount.

I along with most others who drove by for months was very curious about this new large development in the 12 South neighborhood. What was this snazzy new building going to become? 
Aha!
Urban Grub. (love the name and branding BTW)

A few weeks back, my good friend and I had an impromptu brunch experience which ended up lasting way past the typical ""brunch"" hours thanks to the refreshing cocktails, tasty quinoa burrito, and lovely patio area. I am literally smitten with the layout of this place! There are so many interesting nooks and options to enjoy the space. 

Perhaps you want to enjoy the breeze? Two separate patio areas can ensure that you enjoy the weather.  

Prefer a bustling and energetic environment instead? The bar area is spacious and full of vibrant interaction. 

Want to celebrate a special occasion with some privacy? The over sized booths and cozy dining areas will ensure that you get to do just that!

Now onto the food... my brunch was smashing as I noshed on the hearty quinoa burrito that was full of flavor and coupled with their seasoned edamame, this broad was satisfied. 

Fast forward a few weeks later. I made reservations for a dear friend's birthday. We were all seated in a comfy booth while our server was expedient and excellent throughout the evening. He also made some solid food and beverage recommendations for our group which I am especially thankful for considering my veg diet. I was a tad disappointed that there wasn't a vegetarian/vegan option on the dinner menu but with our server's assistance, I was able to tweak one of their taco options into a very tasty meal. The wine selection was excellent as well... I sipped on an intoxicating glass of Malbec. Including tip, I was able to walk out for just $20. Urban Grub's prices are very fair!

You will definitely see me checking into Urban Grub on many more occasions. What a wonderful addition to the 12 South neighborhood.",5.0,2,2

"We bought two bikes at the Trek store about a month ago.  Overall it has been a positive experience but I do have some issues.

When we went in, we were greeted by a very friendly customer service rep who told us about their different bikes and asked what we might be interested in.  We discussed two kinds of bikes that would likely suit us best, but due to the fact that they were to close within the hour, we only looked at one of the bikes.  We asked when we first got there if we could test-ride both bikes and they said that we could, but we ran out of time and wound up purchasing the bikes that we test-rode.  We probably should have said that we would come back so that we could test the other bikes, but we didn't, and that's our fault.  But, I do feel like the staff was eager to get us out of the shop and rushed the process.  While we love our bikes, we have had a few of those ""what if"" moments.  And at $550 and $660 for our bikes, I prefer not to have those moments.  I wish that they had encouraged us to come back so that we could have gotten a better feel for the inventory.

We recently took our bikes in for their complimentary 30-day service.  We arrived just as they opened on Sunday afternoon and asked if we could wait for our bikes while they worked on them.  They informed us that they don't typically perform bike maintenance on Sundays since they are only open for four hours.  I suppose that's fair enough, though I was annoyed that we wouldn't be able to take our bikes home that day.  We were told that we would receive two text messages for the two bikes and to not return for them until both text messages were received.  We were told that we would have them back around noon on Monday.  On Tuesday morning we still hadn't received any messages.  We got one around mid-day and waited for the second message to come through.  Finally, a few hours later, we decided to call to check, and were told that both bikes were ready.  Still no second message.

I know that my issues with the Trek store are largely my being picky about an experience, but in my opinion, if we are going to spend $1500 for two bikes plus all of the accessories that we ""have to have,"" then I expect more out of the customer service.  Sure, everyone has been pretty nice, but for that type of money I think we should be getting a little more.",3.0,1,2

"This is one of my favorite brunch places between Downingtown-Exton-West Chester! Always a pleasure sitting down with friends or family here, especially since there's always something new on the special menu. Been here many times over the years, and I've never had a negative experience. The staff are always very friendly and the service prompt. 

My favorite is the Mainline Benny: poached eggs on avocado and cornbread with hollandaise sauce on top. The pancakes and waffles are also great - super fluffy and plate sized. Savory or decadent, or both, there's always something for everyone. Doesn't hurt that their coffee is delicious and served in miscellaneous mugs, similar to what you might find in your own kitchen cupboard. Everything about Green Street is about comfort food and feeling at home.

As it is a popular restaurant, there is often a wait time during the brunch rush, especially on the weekends. While you're not able to reserve ahead of time on the phone, there's a sign in sheet  where you can leave your number if the wait is really long. And in my opinion, it's worth the wait!",5.0,2,2

"Like Paul K., I first had a taste of Schakolad's chocolate at Arrington Vineyards. The raspberry truffle was one of the best pieces of chocolate I ever had and immediately decided to seek out more. Unfortunately it was on a Sunday so I cried to myself when I got there to find it closed, no satisfying my chocolate craving that day.

I finally made it out there when it was open and OMG (yes, in all caps) this is the best chocolate I have ever had. They have a great assortment of truffles (which they have for you to sample), bark, chocolate covered pretzels and cookies, you name it....and its all DELICIOUS. I think we came out of there with one of everything to try. My favorites so far are the peppermint bark and the key lime truffles. My husband is swearing by the whiskey peach truffles.

All chocolate is made in house and it looks like they do some custom work as well if you're looking for something for a special occasion. I would definitely recommend getting a box (or 5) as a gift for someone(the other 4 to keep for yourself) with a major sweet tooth.

"I went in for an oil change and tire rotation at this location on December 7, 2015. I specifically asked them if my tires were OK because they had just over 50k miles on them and I did not want to be driving in snowy conditions on bad tires

They told me I was lucky I did not experience a blow out on my tires while I was driving. This was exactly one month after Jiffy Lube told me my tires were fine 

They also replaced windshield wipers that had just been replaced at another Jiffy Lube 2 months prior.

"A friend and I decided to check out a comedy show here and when we walked in we immediately realized that we were both really hungry. Buffa's serves food! Perfect! I think that you can eat in the front bar, but the show we were seeing was in the dining area, so we just headed back there.

Looking over the menu, it really does seem like Buffa's has everything. Burgers, sandwiches, breakfast food and even alfredo are all on the menu. I was in the mood for a sandwich, so I decided on a club on rye bread. It came out pretty fast and it was huge! I was so hungry, I didn't even take a picture of it, I just jumped in. It was delicious with turkey, ham and bacon and I finished the entire thing. 

The bartender, who took the order, was super nice and friendly. Although he was busy, he was attentive and was sure to ask how everything was. Buffa's is open 24 hours, so this is a really cool place to stop and eat after a wild night in the quarter. I also really like that the dining area is smoke free.

Now that I am familiar with Buffa's menu, I think I will definitely come back and eat here again.",4.0,2,2

"One star because:
1) the window was installed...eventually
2) there isn't a zero star option

I sold my house in May and the movers broke the transom window above the front door. Stuff happens. The moving company agreed to have the window repaired and chose this company to do the work. In order for closing on the sale of our house to move forward, I agreed to have money held in escrow until the window was repaired. Since I had money I was waiting to get back, I made sure to stay on top of the repair. This company was a nightmare to work with. 
I would call for an update and was told the window was being made but required some unusual piece (not sure what piece that could be exactly...it's just a window. it's not from an old home. it's the same window that the other 100 townhouses in my neighborhood have. but I digress.). I kept being told that the window was being delivered to them, that they were expecting it any day.
So we wait. and wait. and wait. I call again. I'm told that the window is being delivered to them and they will set up an installation. Nothing. I call again. I'm told the window was never delivered to them. No one knows where the window is. They have to have the window made all over again. Finally, I'm told they will have the window in no later than that Wednesday (7/5) and they set up installation with the new homeowner for that Friday (7/7). On 7/8, I follow-up with my realtor to make sure that the work had been done. He contacted the new owner and she said that Nashville Glass just didn't show up on the 7th! On 7/10, I contact Nashville Glass and they tell me they didn't get the window in as expected. And their solution was to just no-show? Not contact anyone? Just waste other people's time? 
I would like to add that this whole time, the woman I was dealing with (Anna-Marie) kept telling me she would let me know when they got the window in, let me know when the installation was scheduled, tell me when the window was repaired, send me a copy of the paid invoice so I could get my money back from the escrow. She took down my phone number, my email address, and she never once followed up. The window was finally repaired on 7/18. She had told me the week before that she'd have the paid invoice sent to me, so I waited. On 7/25, when I hadn't received anything, I called, she took down my email address again, and said she would send it. Never got anything. I called again today (7/27) and she told me she didn't send it because I wasn't the one who paid them. She didn't think to call or shoot me an email with this change of heart?
I know this is long, but one more thing: When she told me the window had to be re-made, she said that the window would be discounted. I told her that was nice but it didn't really help me any since I wasn't paying for the repair but was being made to wait to get my money out of escrow. You think the moving company was given that discount she mentioned? I'll give you one guess...",1.0,0,0

Legit, everything was delicious from the sweet Brussels sprouts, buttery sweet potato croquettes, and tender octopus to the creamy brie and pear jam. The other things we got were also really good.

"We had previously been to this restaurant twice when there was no crowd.  They have a limited menu, but the ribs were great and served quickly.  So last night we decided to take some friends.  They were having an event, but they told us we would be the next to be seated.  We were seated 45 minutes later.  There was an empty table visible to us the entire time that was never filled while we were there.  After we ordered it took 60-90 minutes to get our food.  The sides were brought out 10-15 minutes before the rest of the food, so the mashed potatoes were cold by the time the food came.

"Room was Disgusting!
The old-hotel is okay walking in, the staff is mostly friendly. In fact the person manning the breakfast was great! However, as you move through the hotel the carpets and walls are in need of a good cleaning. Once in the 3rd floor room, it must have been a smoking room at one point. The smell was overwhelming and stuck to everything we owned. The curtains that were once white are yellow nicotine stained. The couch is stained and smells like puke, beer and cigarettes. The bed cover had blood on it. There was dried puke on the wall near the corner of the couch. There was a dirty coffee cup on the floor near the a/c. There is also some sort of substance on the main door, not sure if it was dark red juice or blood. The toilet seat was the wrong size and overhung the toilet. The cabinet that housed the fridge and microwave was needing repair. Couldn't get into the cabinet with the microwave because the hardware was missing and we smashed our fingers trying to get it open. There were stains all over the carpet, couch and walls. Including several holes and patches on the walls, not sure if it was a remodel that never got finished or if this was just laziness. I was unsure when the last time they pulled furniture out to clean behind it, but I wouldn't reach my hand behind anything. I just kept my hands to myself in this room! We only stayed after all this because there weren't any other hotels available and were stuck. After we spoke to the manager, they said they would spend some time cleaning the room while we were out.

We could hear the music loud and clear in the room. While I understand it's not THEIR fault it's loud, they didn't tell us that when we booked the rooms. There is information posted in the lobby and a sound machine in the room (and they offer ear plugs - but honestly, who can sleep with those things in???), However, once you're there to read those warnings.... You've already booked a room and no where else is available!!!! 

If you DO end up staying here, note that the blackout curtains are BEHIND the sheer curtain. We didn't realize it until the second night.

It's Valet parking only, and they charge you 50 dollars for it. COMPLETLY RIDICULOUS. (They don't inform you of that charge until you leave)

Sandbox/Sandbox^2 is a privately-owned daycare. As such, they have a fair amount of latitude when it comes to choosing which children are enrolled. Admirably, they accept children with special needs, including children with emotional/behavioral problems. However, the problem is, they don't provide the necessary direct 1:1 supervision that these special-needs children need; the result is an alarmingly unsafe environment for the other children there.

My wife and I enrolled our (normal) three-year-old son there, only to discover later that he shared a class with two special-needs children, one with violence/agression issues. The staff there had mentioned that the child with violence issues (and apparently his mother) were both in counseling.

Concerned, my wife and I both took turns observing the classroom and playground environment on different days, and found that the level of supervision given to this special-needs child was alarmingly low.  Rather than be directly supervised 1-on-1 by an adult, this child was allowed to openly agressive, acting out against the other children at random, to the point of physically harming them. At one point, within the span of two minutes, my wife observed this child trying to shake another child out of  swing, hitting another child with a tree branch, and picking up a half-broken brick and throwing it at another child. 

There's actually more along the same lines we observed from the second poorly-supervised special-needs child, but, I figure for the sake of this Yelp review that the above story alone illustrates the point we're trying to make--their management/staff's heart is in the right place, but in practice, the lack of supervision given to such children puts the other normal children at risk, and does a disservice to the special-needs kids themselves who would benefit from the guidance such 1:1 supervision provides.

Sadly, children who come from physically abusive homes are often subject to other forms of abuse. The lack of proper 1:1 supervision of such children in the classroom means every other child in that classroom will be potentially subject to the inappropriate behaviors and acting-out of that child. 

No environment is perfectly safe, and children shouldn't be constrained by overprotective parents who want to keep them in bubbe-wrap, but you get the point..This is an accident waiting to happen, particularly in an environment like Sandbox where the children are allowed to do things like go into bathroom areas out of line-of-sight to caregivers by themselves. The risk of a sexually abused child acting out or re-enacting that abuse with a classmate is alarmingly high. 

In any event, back to the story--when bringing this to the attention of the owner, her suggestion was not to arrange that the aggressive/violent child be closely supervised by an adult, but to offer to move _our_ son to a different classroom(!). Sure, this would solve the problem for our son, but what about the safety of the other children still there?! If that's the approach they wish to take, that's their choice, obviously but upon finding that out, we made the decision to withdraw our son from Sandbox immediately. It may be a wonderful learning environment, but without proper consideration given to the children's basic safety, it's meaningless.

My wife and I both believe that the folks who work there genuinely care about their kids, and we both admire their openness towards children with special needs, but how they're going about it is frankly dangerous to other children.. With that kind of policy, it's not a question of _if_, but _when_ something bad (and completely avoidable) is going to happen there.",1.0,0,0

"Have ordered curbside twice due to COVID in the last 2 months. Both times we had to go in to get the order. Kind of defeats the purpose of curbside and puts patrons at risk. Last time we ordered at 4:15 for 6:00 curbside pick up. Pizza not ready after we waited 10 min in the car and then went in. Was told 15-20 min and hostess said they'd bring it out. Nothing. Went back in at 6:35, and still no pizza. Went back in at 6:45 and it was sitting on a table. Cold. It was obvious they were at capacity and were unable to keep up.  When you can't keep up, you turn down new orders. Simple and the right thing to do. Leaving people in the lurch is not appropriate. Looking for another pizza joint with good deep dish.

We had a great server with good timing (even though he commented/apologized on coming by too much- he didn't! He was totally great).
The white truffle garlic bread is TO.DIE.FOR. I didn't taste the truffle but it was super buttery and addicting. The Caesar salad was pretty good but it does have a peppery kick to it. The pizza was decent (albeit small for the price) and the Bolognese was better the second day. At the restaurant (and no offense to the chef that created the recipe) but it quite literally tasted like spicy chef boyardee. That's not to say it was bad.. it was just something we chuckled at seeing how we paid $19 for something that tasted like it was a doctored .98 canned meal.

"I've had two very different experiences here that I think boils down to believing the place is simply over-priced and unpredictable.

The first occassion was a company (department) holiday luncheon (12/09).  The restaurant was very nicely decorated for the season and had a great ""festive"" vibe to it.  The staff was decent, we weren't rushed, and everyone enjoyed their entree.  I had the Stuffed 5 Cheese Sachetti...cooked well with a very nice flavor.

Recently (7/10) I went there to treat myself to a nice dinner (based on my prior experience).  I decided to eat at the bar...big mistake!  I understand you can't control what comes out of the mouth of patrons, but when your bartenders are dropping the f-bomb...that's unacceptable!  I choose the tortellini and scallops.  For $22, I received an appropriate amount of pasta but just 3 scallops.  Ridiculous!!!  And while the first few bites were very flavorful, it wasn't long until I was dining on straight olive oil.

"We came here to celebrate a belated birthday on a weekend in Santa Barbara. My boyfriend and I both agreed that this was one of the five best meals we've ever eaten. Everything about this restaurant was special. 

First off, the service was superb from the moment we walked in the door. The host was very friendly and acted like we were regulars, even though it was our first time. The waiter was attentive but not a ""hoverer,"" and he offered great tips on food and wine that really enhanced the experience.

The food was impeccable. We had the onion soup and a field greens salad for appetizers, the duck and venison for entrees, and the chocolate cake for dessert. All were perfectly prepared (both the meats were cooked *just right*) and beautifully presented. The duck was the best duck I've ever eaten, and the venison, served with a delightful sweet barley mixture, was brilliant as well. If it were socially acceptable for us to lick our plates, we would have.

The wine, recommended by the waiter, was the perfect pairing for our entrees. The wine list is exceptional; it's no surprise Bouchon has been frequently recognized by wine magazines.

"I read up a lot on best places to get Philly cheesesteaks, and this place came up on a few lists so we decided to try it out.

It's located in a weird industrial area and parking isn't great (there is space to park next to the restaurant but the spaces aren't marked or anything so people just park however they want). The place is really tiny on the inside and, I imagine, gets pretty crowded during busy times. 

I was so overwhelmed and concerned that I would get in the wrong ordering line (one for cheesesteaks and one for roast pork, but they pretty much merge together and none of it makes much sense) that I forgot to ask for mushrooms on my cheesesteak. I didn't want to get yelled at for modifying my order (since the people behind the counter were scrambling around making food and bickering with each other) so I just rolled with it. 
An older review said this place is cash only, but it's not; I paid with credit card. 
The food takes a bit to come out because they make it to order. 

The cheesesteak was good, nice and hot. The sesame bun was toasted. The meat could have used more seasoning, in my opinion, but I'll admit I don't know much about ""real"" cheesesteaks. We sat in the little outdoor dining area. They had pickles and banana peppers in the corner, which were a nice addition to the sandwich, although I tried not to think about how long those bins might have been sitting out.

After much research and with a commitment to keeping my money in the neighborhood, I used the online booking system to book a simple cut. The online system was so easy which I really appreciate. I arrived at the salon a half an hour early and after running some errands so I was looking a little rough. Frenchie, the owner, arrived at almost exactly the same time and was sweet enough to start the appointment a little early (I fully expected to have to walk around the block or something until the appointment start time as many folks would have had me do). She asked what I was coming in for and what I wanted specifically etc and we got started. She was very welcoming and focused throughout the appointment. My hair is pretty much exactly what I asked for (which is a relief since I'm going to be in a wedding this weekend). I will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend this business.",5.0,2,1

"Best damn cheesesteak in Philly!

I've been to Pat's and I've been to Gino's. Hell I even tried to go to Garce's Trading Post, but was evidently too late to try ""the best"" cheesesteak in Philly since it's only on the lunch menu. Well screw that black-tie white-collar joint. If you want an actual top notch cheesesteak, and to be around real people, then go to Max's. 

Apart from their exceptional food there's also a bar in the back with seating if you want to eat there. The bartenders are quick to serve and don't have attitudes like other places I've been too. 

Some of you might be thinking ""but wait isn't this in North Philadelphia? What if I get shot?"" To which I say if you're so scared to go to Germantown to experience good food then it's probably not gluten free or ""organic"" enough for you to even bother. As for you real food lovers out there just walk in a zig-zag fashion if it's after night fall. You'll be fine!",5.0,2,2

Very good. A favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. I love the classic atmosphere. The Dean Martin music that frequently plays makes me feel like Ive time traveled to the fifties or sixties in the best possible way. I love how it's not trendy. Some trendy restaurants are all shoe and the food isn't as good. Tommy's doesn't try to be cool but it is because the food is great and it's got old school chic going for it. I sometimes wish the free bread was better but I just don't like the seeds on it. And the last time I went I ordered a fish fish and my portion was very small. But otherwise I'm always happy at Tommy's overall,4.0,2,2

The coffee is solid with Hazelnut available every day alongside their house brew and decaf. Additionally they have rotating special drinks and latte flavors.

We were so excited to try this new restaurant as we are on vegan and vegetarian diets but adore Mexican cuisine.  We were also excited to enjoy dining again in the wonderful space where Bird restaurant used to be.   We enjoyed the quiet open space and view of the elegant bar. No longer!  What a disappointment!  We were seated by an ugly metal partition wall which must bounce and magnify the noise of the lower ceilings and smaller enclosed room.  The acoustics were deafening!  We could hear conversations from every table in the room and we could barely speak with each other or the server!  The food was also nothing we would rush back for.  Even though the server said nothing was very spicy - It was!  Everything was loaded with hot peppers and garlic and it killed any flavor of the the vegetables or masa.   The servers did not come back to ask about our dishes and we wouldn't have been able to tell them if they did - because of the horrible noise level in the restaurant.

"We went to visit our good friends, Mike M and his wife, for a weekend in Philly.  They live in Conshohocken within walking distance of El Limon.  When they both raved about this place, we knew we had to try it - we beat the lunch rush and were the first table to be seated.

The decor was homey and welcoming, and you could see the cooks making everything fresh on the premises.  Part of the appeal is that you can hear the sounds of peppers and chicken being chopped and the sizzle as the meat hits the hot grill. We started with super crispy hand-cut tortilla chips fried to perfection were served with creamy guacamole and hot salsa.  Two other squeeze bottles of green and reddish salsas hit the table, and then, before we knew it, our main entrees arrived.

I ordered one chicken sope (corn-based fried disc loaded with beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and chicken, with delicious sauce and cheese on top) and one pork taco.   Both were amazing.  No complaints.  The sope had a lovely crunch on the outside and a comforting, starchy, corn-y heft that made me feel warm and happy on the inside.  My first time eating a sope and certainly not my last - I may try to make it at home!

Both ladies were very pleasant and one escorted me up to the second floor waiting room. She spoke about the other services they provide. 

The waiting room is dimly lit and their is soft music playing throughout. I think they accidentally double booked Ashley, as I waited 15-20 minutes, which wasn't that big a deal (in my opinion). Ashley met me and brought me into the treatment room, where she also had music playing. She asked me what I was looking for and walked me through the process. She got to work right away and even asked if the temperature of the wax was OK. She also filled my brows in with a pencil before letting me see the finished look. I am very happy with my brows. She listened when I said I didn't want them too thin and she didn't try to change my look. I will definitely be returning in 5 weeks and will recommend to friends in the area.",4.0,2,2

"My family and I was very fortunate to have Madison as my tour guide on our sugar cane plantation tour. Madison made our tour one of the best ones I've ever had. He was diligent in texting me when he was coming to pick up my family and was on time! Madison also had extensive knowledge of the New Orleans area and was very funny and witty telling jokes and relating with the guests on our tour. Through our conversations, we found out that Madison is a very educated man holding a degree in Physics from Tulane! How about that!!! He was able to explain some physics to my children as well as tell us about the realities of the people we were seeing as we were driving towards the Plantation. He explained to us about the history of the people around the area and that many were actually descendants of the slaves that were working on the fields. He also explained the history of the Creole movement which I found truly fascinating! When we reached the plantations, Madison was quick to grab our tickets and we were swiftly off learning all the rich historical history of the Laura plantation and Oak Alley Plantation! Simply marvelous!!! At the end of both tours, he simply just let us soak it all by playing some of his favorite blues music that really made the whole experience enjoyable and memorable!

The buns are made fresh with a little brand on the top.  The chicken is breaded perfectly with fantastic flavor that is not over the top spicy.  The secret sauce is an appropriate amount and compliments the chicken well.  Add a little lettuce, pickle, cheese and you've got the best chicken slider EVER.  Tried the pizza from Tony G's and it was average.... I prefer Idaho pizza.  The spicy tenders from Wing Dome were delish.  We got them w Buffalo Sauce.  The sushi from Omakasa was extremely fresh...... how you would want your raw fish.  Bonus points for the fancy take out boxes.

The problem is that Jan, the owner, is a real jerk! Customer service is not in his vocabulary.
This past Wednesday at 3:30 pm I placed an order for 75 sliced bagels to be picked up at 6:45 the following morning. The women that took my order checked in the back to be certain the order could be completed and ready for a quick pick up. I even pre-paid to expedite the pick up on Thursday AM as I had a time issue. I was told it would be ready.
When I came to pick up, the staff reacted as if they did not even know the order existed. I understand mistakes happen, but I expected more. It took 10 minutes to get the order ready and I was 10 minutes late.
I stopped by today to speak with Jan. I expected a simple ""I'm sorry, I should have done better"". What I got were excuses about young, inefficient, slow staff that does not know what is going on. I was shocked at his lack of accepting responsibility and understanding. He said I should have placed the order earlier and it was an unrealistic expectation to expect my order to be ready.

I have been to this place and gotten good service, not great but just OK. 

Then I have been here and gotten the worst service and food I have attempted to eat. 

The rolls are good when they are good and bad most of the time. 

I had a chicken sandwich here once that was just plain disgusting and had really bad toppings, the tomatoes were soggy and gross and the lettuce was wilted and half rotten. 

Other times I have been here for lunch and it was awesome, their chicken tenders are incredible. I am pretty sure that they are fresh made. 

The time I was here for lunch I was with some fellow employees and the waitress was attempting to ask us if we wanted to join the lunch program they had and she could not for the life of her finish the sentence she was working on. I literally started cracking up and said no we do not want to join your lunch club.

To the burgers - they were fantastic. Cooked to perfection, fresh ingredients, perfect portion size, and good to the very last bite. I just wish I had added bacon to the sandwich, but recall I was sticking with the basics! 

The atmosphere was cool and had a chill vibe too! Clean, good service. We were able to park in front of the building, walk right in and order and the food came soon after we sat down. They also have available sidewalk seating.

The inside was not well designed. The eating area inside was packed with tables, very hard to maneuver around and not much standing room to place an order. They were a little slow at getting our order, and seemed that they could only do one order and fill it at a time.

"It seems like new sushi places come and go in Reno. We hope Hinoki sticks around a long time. We checked it out on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all. Our chef was super personable, and interested to open a conversation about how we found the place and comparisons to sushi places in our town.

The menu is rather limited compared to some of the other places in town - but the offerings are creative and inspired. My favorite of the non-standards was the Ceviche roll. The awesome thing is you can ask for just about anything you want and they can make it.  You can also just give some suggestions oh the things you like and let your chef be creative. The fish quality was definitely a notch above anyplace else I have been to lately.

Another plus is the location. It's out of the way just enough to make it good. No traffic and no parking hassle - but not too far out of the way. It's quite easy to pair it with a trip to Trader Joe's.

"First off I will say that the service and ambience were great. I went there this past Sunday with a group of 6 and we all did bottomless mimosas and sangria's. They had several different types of each which was a welcome sight while being modestly priced at $18. What I didn't appreciate was when I asked if the sangrias could have a floater, knowing there would be some sort of up-charge, was answered with a ""Yes they can!"" And a  ""not exactly sure what it will be but we can absolutely do that for you."" Turns out they'll charge you the $18 plus an additional $15 per sangria for a brandy floater on the bottomless deal, which as you can imagine made the bill quite sizable. Next issue was with the chicken and waffles. Fairly simple order and difficult to make into a negative review, but the chicken was very plain (unseasoned, basic, boring, thin fried chicken) and the syrup given with the plate for the waffle was infused with rosemary. Normally I enjoy something new or a nice flavor I didn't expect to my plate, not in this case. Gave the maple syrup a pine-like flavoring and was not appealing in the least. The service, vibe and ambiance kept this review from being 1.5/2 stars, unfortunately let down with the one plate I received and lack of information about the floater up-charge. With the other brunch selections in and around S. Howard I doubt I'll be returning there.",3.0,1,2
"A nice place to enjoy views of La Cumbre Peak and Cathedral Peak (particularly from the upper garden), which conveniently also has nice views of the ocean.  I'd visit on a clear day, spring & summer are very nice as far as the meadows go.  However, the redwood forest can be enjoyed all year round.  There is often some kind of cool earthen/wooden sculpture in the main meadow.  I'd also recommend checking out the path down to the teahouse (I've yet to visit when it's open, but with advanced planning maybe you could be so lucky).
  You can take dogs here, I'd probably keep them on leash though.  Admission is fair, 8$ p/p seems a bit steep but seniors or students are just 6$, and children 2-12 are 4$.  I know there are plenty of places where you do not need to pay to hike, but this is a nice place to see a few times a year or once per visit to the area.  P.S.  I think there are some areas that may be handicap-accessible, but I wouldn't count on the whole garden being accessible should that be of concern for your party.  Also, I wouldn't recommend visiting until a few days after a rain, unless you really want to track home a lot of mud.",3.0,1,2
"Revisited there recently. Use to be a favorite lunch/dinner spot when I lived in the Castor Garden area many moons ago when it was actually still a desirable area to live, but enuff said there! I appreciate that they are one of the few left hold outs from the gold ole days on Castor Ave! I believe they are still owned by the same family! (which is a good thing food quality wise) the only change I noticed is that they service alcohol there now!   Anyway back to the food, still good ! The snapper soup is still the best around and the platters are decent size, no thrills but priced below average diner fare. Solid friendly waitresses nice service all around. Parking can be hit or miss in that area depends when you go. All in all, a good solid choice!",4.0,2,2
"We've rented electric bikes from Perego Electric Bikes Santa Barbara three times this summer and will again next week when the in-laws come in.

It's a nice way to enjoy the great weather and not have to deal with parking, traffic and the heavy summer crowds. Last summer we rented from another electric bike place in town before, but prefer the Pedego bikes. They're super easy to learn to use, powerful, and carry a long-lasting charge.

This last experience was the worst however. We ordered three pounds of crawfish and they were BLAND and not even served hot. They needed a little seasoning on them, they were just too plain for me. We noticed they had to start telling customers they were out of crawfish while eating, and while we were leaving, we overhead the staff saying they had a little more crawfish left (talking about ours left over on the table).. This is unacceptable in a restaurant and will not eat here again.",2.0,0,0

1. Very helpful when I asked questions. They all seemed knowledgeable about what I asked them.

Cons:
1. Not a huge selection of fabrics, but a good amount for a small store.

3. A bit messy.

"OUTSTANDING! Our little one had a first dental visit with another dentist office, and it went south fast. Not the fault of the dentist at all, it was just a natural reaction, so we looked for a pediatric dentist & so happy to find Dr. Bryan.

This place is welcoming and the Dr really tries to get to know your family and talks to your child before even going to the dental chair. Does a great job of trying to build rapport with a child. Also provides great info to support your child's dental health.

Then it was time for the cleaning. Needless to say ours cried and dad had to hold him, but Dr. Bryan was swift and it was done efficiently and quickly. He cleaned our child's teeth (despite the yelling and tears) and took care of any teeth issues! Our little one (once it the car) said Dr. Bryan was nice and it didn't hurt. 

Dr. Bryan and his staff really knows how to support and work in these challenging situations. The office is clean and welcoming as well for families.",5.0,2,2

Bad service and extremely overpriced food for what it is extremely disappointing was in the restaurant one night and was promptly seated but a half an hour went by without a waitress or a drink order placed. I could overlook this if it was a busy night and they were short staffed but there were maybe 10 people there including me and my friend and all of the waitstaff was sitting around laughing and joking and talking and completely not having a crap to give....I later gave this place a second chance with my girlfriend and I and the service was better but just standard not outstanding and we didn't get a lot of food but the bill was huge for what we ordered almost any other restaurant in the Tampa area would be a better choice.

My hunger demanded beef. Lots of it and kisses by flame. It was time to try Big Daddy's. The interior is really surprising! The bar looks well stocked and capable but it isn't the reason for this visit. This time I come for the beef. Looking at the my eyes locked on a $20 Big Daddy Double Burger. You might think oh that's like a double quarter lb. or something. YOU ARE WRONG! Reading the fine print I realized quickly I would be leaving much of this burger behind since patties are 1/2 lb and there are 4 on it. That's 2 lbs of meat. What! Okay I regain sanity and choose the Smokehouse burger with a paltry 1/2 lb. okay that's my speed. We order fries with Big Daddy spice (Probably beef bouillon and seasoning salt. Idk). The burger arrives. The bun has been properly toasted. Toppings look good. Fries are hot and crispy. This burger was amazing. It didn't come at the intended temperature of medium but it was very tasty. We will be back.,4.0,2,2
"Oh wow! This is definitely a new favorite Carmel park. This is the perfect park for children who love to climb, because there are so many walls to scale, and rock climbing features, and monkey bars, and just things to hang off of in general. 

There are also rope bridges, balance beams, really big slides and slides for little kids, tunnels, a rocking boat, a teeter totter for four, swings, forts, hidey holes to sit in, trampolines ... I'm sure I'm forgetting something because there is just so much fun stuff. It absolutely has something for all ages and abilities. It is awesome. Plus, the ground is made of that flexible tire material, so it's soft under your feet. 

There is also a splash pad here! It looks super fun, but unfortunately it wasn't open for summer 2016. We're looking forward to playing in it next year!

"I would like to thank Sam and the staff at Import Auto Maintenance for fitting my 1995 Honda Passport into their schedule early Friday morning. Anyone can relate to the complete feeling of dread when you walk out to your car to start your Friday and the car won't turnover. Nothing but fear that you won't have a car for the day or weekend since most garages will already be booked.

I immediately knew it was the starter that needed to be replaced. I'd moved to the city but not had a chance to find a mechanic to take over servicing my car. So, I quickly looked up on Yelp to see who I was close too and found AIM.

I called and Sam answered to tell me to bring it in now. I was able to get it started by beating on the starter. Then I drove straight to AIM for their help. I did not tell them I was in a hurry to get it back. 

And it got done around 1PM that Friday for me to make my appointments only slightly late.

Thanks again AIM! You'll be seeing me again soon with some elective upgrades soon.",5.0,2,0
"I have friends with horror stories about being Peach's tenants, but we'll leave them to write their own reviews. 
This is about my experience being a neighbor of a Peach property, known on our block as the Peach Pit.
Peach treats our neighborhood like a slum. 
The back of the property, where the trash cans are, is on a small residential street.  Peach's tenants dump all kinds of garbage on the street: broken glass, stinky kitchen garbage, broken furniture, just to name what's out there at the moment. 
As I write this there are two busted sofas, and an armchair with a big pile of poo on the seat. Smells like Peach!

The BBQ Shrimp app was tiny 2 prawns and 1 small shrimp (kinda strange to include just 1).

I finally had a hurricane here. It was pretty sweet. I'll take sazerac as a signature NOLA drink over this.

One interesting thing about this place is you can make your dish ""creole style."" This means they add crawfish and creole spices to your dish. My husband opted for this to go with his fish, and it elevated the dish.

I ordered the signature pepper-crusted duck dish. I asked for med rare, but this was more like medium. It was still pretty good. The accompanying foie gras was mediocre though.

The staff made it very easy to go with a large group: everyone got their own separate check.

Philly Flavors is probably my favorite place on Fairmount Ave because ice cream is the best.  Some may argue, no, pizza is the best...but Philly Flavors is so good that you can actually get pizza right next door, and then get some ice cream...which is the best.

Their sundaes are massive beasts of seemingly bottomless ice cream.  Their peanut butter sauce is on point, and they have a wide array of sugar free and low fat flavors.  They also serve water ice - I'd suggest checking out mint chocolate chip or vanilla chip.

"I went here looking for some trees to create some privacy for my house....  Our cars have been rifled through and rocks thrown through our window AND someone tried to steal my car...  Privacy screening was sounding more and more enticing!!

I spoke with Mark who was very knowledgable and took the time to assess my needs and discuss strategies.  He said he has a huge number of trees on his own property that he's installed and had very much enjoyed the trees he recommended and which I ended up purchasing.  They were running a deal so I was able to get out of there for 40% off for 4 trees, which included a lifetime guarantee!!!  Pretty sweet. 

Also, it happened to be during the stretch of 100+ degree days we had in August, and I was NOT about to take the trees home so they could shrivel up and die!!  Plus they wouldn't all fit in my car.  

So, I was able to leave the trees there and know they'd be watered... then didn't get there to pick them up again for 2 WHOLE MONTHS!!!  My bad.  But it was still really hot and...well, I'm a little lazy, and the car thing....  But I went back in mid October fingers crossed (Perfect tree-planting season said Mark) and they were still there and healthy.  He even remembered me and the trees I'd bought, loaded them in E-Dawg's truck, AND comped me two bungee cords.  He hadn't even asked if I had rope or anything.

My only issue was that they could have planted the trees for me as well but I would have had to supply all the sprinkler parts.  (Um, whut?!) 

This place can be pricey for sure but if you catch them during one of the sales and don't buy the trinkety gardens things you can get a good deal.  I did price a couple places before purchasing here.  All the gardening staff I've ever spoken with has been really knowledgeable and helpful.",4.0,2,2

Yes, you will sweat but it's really about personal challenges / fulfillment. With respect to the studio, it's very neat and clean. Some weekend classes can get crowded so show up a little early to avoid the check-in line. Nothing beats the warmth of the studio on a cold / bitter day but, I have to say, that I also enjoy the studio in the summer heat. As soon as I walk in, I can feel my entire body start to relax.",5.0,2,2
"I feel so-so about this place . I will say they have ALOT of cool games to play with and it's really cool how they even have bowling lanes. They also have great selections of prizes to pick from. However , the ticket reward system is unreasonable . Most, if not all of the aracade games were extremely expensive for no reason . Something as simple as the claw machine was 6 tickets . If you play for tickets honestly expect to see your money down the drain , we paid $45 and it lasted us not even an hour. The customer service was great and I love the fact that they have a dining area and that it's located in Ybor; which has a lot of places to visit .I wouldn't come back just because it's just not worth the cost.",3.0,1,1

"I have taken my dog, Ludo, here for boarding, and just recently he had an evaluation for playing during their doggy day care, so I am excited to begin taking him to that. This facility is wonderful, the staff are kind and friendly and so welcoming. Every time Ludo has been taken here, he gets soooo excited and greets everyone like they are his best friend. I take that as a huge hint that this place treats him very well. Their pricing is very reasonable, from the daycare to the boarding prices, especially knowing that Ludo is actually having such a good time while he stays there.",5.0,2,2
"The first time I went to Dobbs I was spoken to rudely and unprofessionally. Unfortunately, I figured this would be the case at just about any auto shop, because I'm a small 22 year old woman. The work they did was fine and well priced, so I went back a couple of months later looking for an oil change. The man looked me dead in the eye and told me my car *only* takes synthetic oil ($40 more expensive). Luckily I left and looked this up in my car manual. It was a complete lie. Jokes on them for thinking they could scam me for $40, maybe if they hadn't lied I would have returned in the future. Now I will never be back.",2.0,0,0
"I'm like any other self respecting man on this planet: I despise fro yo establishments. The whole concept is insane. Come to this hideously-decorated, mod box with uncomfortable furniture and eat this outrageously priced frozen milk, that was free everyday in college, topped with fruit and cereal, also free in college and eat it by the pound. All while gossiping with your friends. No wonder girls love this place! Women all across the planet drag their unassuming boyfriends through snowstorms to sit and watch them seductively eat their frozen milk while not getting fat (yeah right). That's why I highly suggest turning your significant other onto gelato. At least you can find something to eat at Capo Giro. Anyways, aside from my sociological disagreement with fro yo places,  I had to review this place due to the appalling experience I had on a grey, wintry evening.

I was sitting there in an extremely uncomfortable chair that distorted my buttocks into a tight flower bud, when I looked over to see a young couple enjoying fro yo with their two babies. I continued my fruitless conversation about unbridled love and our future together, when I glanced back over only to see a baby's bare ass with a bright, brown paste smeared all over it. Yes that is correct, the nice young couple decided to change their baby's diaper on the table in the middle of the fro yo place, with other people within plain view. Not the most appetizing thing I've ever seen, in fact I'm so scarred from this experience that not only do I now hate fro yo with even more vigor, but I don't want to have children for another ten to fifteen years... at least. Full disclosure- it looked like the byproduct of an alien.",1.0,0,0
"We booked the sunset cruise online ""the upper deck""
On their website they allow only 10 persons in the upper deck for the social distancing but there were actually 12 persons which it didn't bother me.
We loved the cruise. It was beautiful and we had a chance to watch groups of dolphins. It is like an hour and half cruise. So you don't get bored and in the same time you have enough enjoyment. The crew was friendly and they provided a good friendly service. I recommend the cruise for everyone visiting Santa Barbara.",5.0,2,2
"Very photographable environment. Nicely plated food. That's about it. Food was bland at best. Service was mediocre.

"Needed a place to crash after a Saturday night event in Old City and the Holiday Inn Express at Penns Landing fit the budget and our location preference, and it wound up being adequate for our needs.

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon to find a parking lot and hotel entrance that are currently under construction. The entrance to the parking lot is just past the hotel itself and currently surrounded by a lot of orange construction fencing (as of July 2019). There was plenty of parking available, and when we checked in, the parking cost ($30/night) was added to our bill and our parking tickets were taken in exchange for hotel keys. 

Our room ""with a view"" overlooked the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and Cherry Street Pier, which was pretty nice. However, the trade-off is that we were bombarded with Columbus Street traffic noise all night, which was surprisingly loud (likely because it was a Saturday night, which I'm sure brought out the best in people...). It was a short 10 minute walk to be in the center of Old City, which was perfect for our needs.

Our queen beds were somewhat firm but overall fairly comfortable. The room was clean and stocked with a Keurig and several coffee options as well as the typical basic toiletries. It was a bit noisy throughout the night; our room was between the elevator and the stairs and likely got a decent amount of foot traffic. The free breakfast was typical --- mediocre omelets, bagels, cereals, yogurts, and beverages. The pancake machine was out of order at the time. There was plenty of seating despite the fact that we arrived at prime breakfast time on a Sunday morning. 

Overall, the location and price were worthwhile for a one-night stay, though the noise level would make me think twice if I had an important event in Philly that required adequate rest.",3.0,1,1
"We live in Roxborough and have eaten here often. The food is good, we like the lobster bisque soup, chicken wings, stuffed peppers and so abundant that taking home leftovers is routine. My one peeve is that they add an 18% tip as an added menu item with no line separating it from the food or drinks so, unless you read the bill carefully you end up adding an extra tip when you pay which is very irritating to me, since, as others have remarked, the service is not outstanding. So, go but caveat emptor.

It's the perfect self-indulgence gift for beginners and seasoned professionals.  Their customer service is on point and their shipping is fast and reliable. I currently live in California, but would like plan a special trip to visit their store in St. Louise once the pandemic is over.

"I'd give it no stars, but I was raised to be nice. Here's what you can do to improve your business and win back mine. Right now you've lost it.

1. Tone down the sweetness of your sauce and add more herbs.

2. I saw your guy breaking apart my frozen fettuccine from a block of frozen fettuccine. He did this right after taking my order, BUT before he washed his hands. Stop using frozen fettuccine, make your white sauce daily. Like you claim you do with that red sauce. Teach your employees proper sanitation.

3. Don't use pre packaged frozen food. If you're wondering why your business is suffering it's because you charge an arm and a leg for pizza that is much worse than little caesar's.

4. Your meatballs tasted spongey and possibly are turning. Throw them out, make them fresh. If you are making them fresh, find a new recipe.

One of the wines had turned, and the bartender wouldn't replace it. We could see empty tables which could have been pulled and grouped for us, but the hostess said she couldn't do that because of the exit. Eventually, we were seated at the bar. We had to ask for our bread and create our own olive oil dipping plate. A bunch of young white kids came in, and the tables were moved for them. I have never been so embarrassed.

"This is seriously the worst convenience store I have ever gone to. This place is always super busy because of the campus location but that is hardly the problem.

I stopped coming here a few weeks ago and I buy my convenience store items from foodway across the street. I only go here late at night if nothing else is open and I need cigarettes.

Seriously avoid this place if you can, foodway across the street is a million times nicer and have a lot of the same things. I wish we could get wawa on campus instead of 7/11 because 7/11 sucks really hard and their food is disgusting, but it seems like temple and 7/11 have made some sort of evil business contract which states only 7/11's may be built on campus in perpetuity.

Before my flight me friend and I stopped here for a quick bite.

For sure top 3 best burger places in Saint Louis and again; I have only tried this place once. 

My friend enjoyed his double burger so much that he went in immediately after for another single. I ended up ordering a melt and the taste was spectacular. The meat was juicy, every bite had a feeling that made me regret trying other sub-par burger establishments in Saint Louis. Also, I have to take account the fries, most places I go have a great burger but the fries are often neglected.

"I wish I read into the review more deeply before deciding on Nonna's - it was either this place or Pietro's and I opted for the one with the better overall rating. Visited on a Sunday night around 7 so there were some folks at the bar watching the football game and a good amount of people in the back. 

Service was good at first since the waitress was attentive and friendly. It tapered down at the end of the night when they stopped coming back to fill our waters or getting the check. Seemed like they were more focused on cleaning. Nothing special about the decor or ambiance.

We tried the mussel appetizer which was cooked well but it lacked some flavor in the sauce. The sauce tasted mostly of fresh parsley (which seems to be a recurring theme in their dishes). I ordered the sea bass and I was really disappointed. Fish was luke warm and tasted buttery, the vegetable medley was too soft and again had a strong buttery taste, and the potato of the day (I still don't know what it was exactly) which was like sliced potatoes with some kind of gravy were warm on top but cold for the ones at the bottom of the plate. UGH, olive garden makes better food than that. We also had Linguini Nonna which was the better of all the dishes and piping hot, but again it had too much parsley. Seafood in it was a bit overcooked as the calamari was tough. 

Thankfully it ended on a better note with the tiramisu which was better and tasted homemade. Could've gone easier on the cream/cheese layers but you can taste the coffee and rum in it. Sorry, but I won't be anxious to come back any time soon.",2.0,0,1

"Tusen takk - thank you very much in Norwegian.  I hope that's right, because that's how I feel about Ruth's Pull Up a Chair Cafe.   
My wife and I visited them yesterday on a very rare breakfast date without the kids and had an outstanding meal.  
I had the lefse, a delicious crepe-like dish that was like nothing I've ever tasted before.   It has a nice combo of sweet and savory that one doesn't get with a typical breakfast.  I also ordered a potato pancake with a delicious blend of zucchini and squash with a nice dollop of sauce.  
My wife ordered the blueberry pancakes (which she allowed me to try) which were some of the best I've tasted.  

I LOVE breakfast fare.  It's comfort food and while it would appear fairly simple (throw some batter on the skillet) a place like Ruth's shows what can be done with creativity and an expert's touch.

"Perhaps I need to try a different location, but I'm not quite sure about all the hype... it has never not been busy when I've gone however and tonight was no different. It was extremely loud tonight which caused me to make my husband wait for the food while I sat in the car after ordering. I have to say basic service for the cashier, although I have to say she was nicer than the others I've encountered here.

I've been there before and the food never been bad, but not ever my first suggestion nor choice, although I do like their cochinita. 

This trip I ordered a Mexican torta sandwich with no cheese as I'm breastfeeding and my daughter has a reaction to any dairy I eat. Because of this I asked how it was prepared and asked for it to be made so that I could enjoy it, adding guac to sort of make up for the cheese I'd be losing out on. I made it a combo with the rice and refried beans on the side along with a fountain drink for the extra two bucks. All together for four people it ended up being forty dollars give or take.

They have one of those drink dispensers with the billion different coke choices which is always nice for the variety and I went ahead and got my drink and ran back to my vehicle while I waited for my to go order which thankfully didn't take too long.

When I got home, however,  I was less thrilled. Overall the sandwich wasn't awful but it was definitely toasted in butter which I wish I would have been informed of, ya know,  perhaps  when I mentioned that I couldn't have dairy...also the jalapeños on my sandwich were essentially a jalapeño sliced in half and thrown on to the cochinita which was just piled into the middle of the sandwich and needed to be reconstructed by me. When I had asked what came on the sandwich I was told beans. Lies :p I added the beans that came on the side after scraping of the cheese they had sprinkled on top of those as well. :/ 

I ate the sandwich against my better judgement and while my baby hasn't seemed affected by any of the dairy yet (and hopefully it was a small enough amount she won't), my own stomach feels wrecked.",2.0,0,1

"Great breakfast burrito & intelligentsia coffee. They offer a house blend, a dark roast and decaf, at least the mornings we've been. It came out out to about $13, which was well worth the quality, service, and cozy atmosphere. Oh, and the warmed cinnamon rolls are dangerously buttery and delicious. 

I appreciate that they bus their own tables, unlike some newer food spots. It's a casual and homey atmosphere. 

Cupcakes are available in the adjacent bakery. They also carry mini versions of their cupcakes if you just want a taste.",4.0,2,2
"I'm super happy that a MM is finally in STL - after hearing about it from friends in other states, I've been wanting to try it forever.  I had to wait awhile as everyone else in the city wanted to but it was well worth the wait!

Our waitress was super awesome.  She had plenty of suggestions on what to order from the menu for each thing we were going to order.  We started out with the spinach & artichoke dip, which came with toasted bread for the dip - delicious!  We were eyeing the pretzels, and our waitress of course shared the details about them, so we have plans to get them next time.  For our pizza, we love thick crust - the thicker the better - and that's what we told her and she suggest we get their original crust which would be covered in a garlic topping.  Oh man, it hit the spot!

The prices are in the middle but you are certainly getting what you paid for.  Another great rating because they have Coke Zero, which is great in my book!

We will definitely be back.  They don't take reservations but they use a no wait app - however it wasn't working the night we went so we did have a bit of a wait but it wasn't bad.",5.0,2,2

"Such a fun spot!!! We had the best time at 21st Amendment. I knew I wanted to go there to listen to some music after we read all the positive yelp reviews, but we didn't think the show would still be going on at 8 since their online calendar said shows start at 6 and at 9. I just assumed there would be a break. We got lucky and actually stumbled into a phenomenal singer and band. We loved loved loved Sierra Green & the Soul Machine. The band was amazing, but Sierra's voice and presence just takes it over the top. We were sad that we only arrived towards the end and could only enjoy four songs. 

The drinks were also very good, and after stopping by a couple of live music bars in the city, we felt that 21st Amendment was the classiest and most fun place.",5.0,2,2

"It's all about the macaroons here. Macaroons macaroons macaroons. They are heavenly! :) I tried their macaroons for the first time today and immediately had to go back for more to bring home. They are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside... Yum! I have to say though, that I am not fond of crazy flavors, that's may be why I didn't enjoy their cashew siracha lime flavor (they taste like Pho to me, I'm just being honest), but their fruity flavors are wonderful. Make sure if you visit, get a macaroon! 
I also tried their tiramisu, and I'm afraid I have to say I don't like it. Why you ask? It's really watery. I enjoy their cream part, but they chose to make their tiramisu with a cake base instead of a cookie/lady finger base. Cake is spongy and moist, they don't soak up the liquid as much as dry cookies like lady fingers would. I also didn't taste the coffee flavor much. The would thing didn't hold together very well... 
But however, due to the high reviews from others, and because of their fantastic macaroons, I will definitely don't back. May be try something else than the tiramisu...",4.0,2,2
The food is okay. Tried the Katsu chicken but it came with bbq sauce. It was pretty weird and I would much rather have L&L BBQ.

The pasta is made right next door, and they have really unique drinks that you must try if you go. I also think it was pretty reasonably priced.

"I discovered Audabon in early July, and oh my God am I glad I did. As a commuting intern in the city over the summer, I delighted in stopped by the stand at the Suburban Concourse on my way home and trying different mac flavors every few weeks. The puddings are great too! I'd tried the Buttermilk Panna Cotta, which is delicious, the first time I went, and then bought macs on my returning visits (I'm hooked). I went again yesterday after a serious craving compelled me to, and bought almond tofu macarons and the famous salted caramel pudding. Ok, I'd heard that the pudding was amazing, but I was shocked at how much I loved it. It is divine, I tell you, and I don't usually even like caramel!!! 

The macs are a different story. Each one is the perfect size, texture, and the flavors- OMG the flavors. Audrey has come up with some of the most creative, unexpected flavors ever. Miso caramel popcorn, masala chai, strawberry daifuku, grapefruit wasabi?!! The Asian inspired macs are always a surprise, and I haven't even tried that many of them simply because they sell out so quickly and I usually go towards the end of her selling time!!! Also, the green tea passion fruit and jasmine ones are amazingggg. I could talk about Audabon all day. 

This place is the next big thing in Philly, and I can't wait to see it happen. In the meantime, I'll be back tomorrow for another set of macs to share with friends back on campus.",5.0,2,2
"I went here last week with some friends for dinner, and had a really good time. 

The food was basically Spanish tapas with a twist, and my friend, who studied abroad in Oviedo last year, said these were some of the best tapas she ever had. Everything we tried was delicious, and presentation was always beautiful. However, I would recommend sticking to the tapas instead of the cheeses & charcuterie, as I felt they were more creative. Also, we ordered some tapas, paella, and desert, and ended up paying about $23, which was SO inexpensive for the quality and even amount of food we received. Will definitely order cocktails next time. And definitely don't skip dessert; it was definitely my favorite part of the meal. 

The only reason I am giving this four stars is because service was not that great, waitresses were snobby and just not at all friendly.",4.0,2,2

BBQ pulled pork special was anything but special. So little BBQ on the roll I ditched the roll top.  More coleslaw on the Sammy then Pork. Finally, don't try to salt your fries. Sure it's humid, but consider that when your putting your shakers out. Oh, and maybe you want to CLEAN the shakers once in a while. Gross.",1.0,0,2

One time when we came there were two girls working, and one just stood texting/Facebooking while the other stood watching the crepes. The absolute shortest I've ever waited was 15 minutes and that's when I was the only person there. The longest, from walking in the door to getting food? An hour. For a crepe.

But this week was particularly difficult and we also were contendering with a complicated oral surgery for a family member and had special requests. This restaurant executed, with excellence, every odd, out of normal request we made. It helped make a difficult, emotionally crazy night, simple. We made our order with our requests and they respected every one. How often do people order just extra cheese from other places and don't get it? This location honored every move and need.

"Decided to eat at here based on positive yelp review. What a mistake. The food came out looking delicious but that's where the positive experience ended. The overall quality of the food was below average. We ordered Orange Chicken, Beef Stir Fry, Beef Wrapped Pancakes, Pork Burger, and a Pork Cutlet. The Pork Burger pics were what got me to go in the first place. The food came out within minutes. I mean all of it like it was sitting under a lamp. The Pork was cold and overcooked as if it had been sitting under heat all day. The first beef wrapped pancake was alright except the bland chewy beef. The second one was full of gristle and I tossed most of the meat it was the failure of the night. The pork cutlet was average except the breeding was a little soggy. The orange chicken was good and I would order again but not so good I would go out of my way. Now about the service. The service was actually very good which surprised me after reading some of the reviews. What upset me was when I almost double tipped. They neglected to tell me they added a 20% gratuity. This was funny because I would have tipped a few more dollars to round up to $50 since the service was good. Sorry but I never saw a sign in the place stating this policy. (Maybe I missed it) I then checked their menu twice not mention of this policy. I also checked their website nothing. They then said it was policy w parties of six or more. I noticed however on the receipt they stated we were a party of seven WRONG. Oh and by the way this massive party of ours was the wife and I, our kids, and my father. Really auto gratuity? The place was empty when we left. The kids are 5, 6, and 10. Oh well guess it just annoys me plus I felt like it was BS they tried to slide it in with no mention. 3 for service and 2 for quality.

"Uncle Bill, I had higher expectations!

I was so pumped for some pancakes that I didn't even care that there wasn't a biscuit and gravy meal (which is my usual for breakfast). I got the supreme 2x2x2x2 and it was a little underwhelming. I felt as though nothing was seasoned at all and the meat was kinda funky. Now the pancakes, great flavor, but mine were very undercooked in the middle, so I only ate the edges so I could avoid the doughy center.

The atmosphere leaves something to be desired... If to frequent diners, it's probably on par, but it just looked very dated and, honestly, a bit dirty.
However, the service was awesome. We never ran out of coffee or other drinks and our orders all came out perfect.

Food is amazing. Server made a lot of effort to help me find something I would really like that wasn't too spicy. I had the butter chicken and garlic naan and they were so good. My husband  had the lamb pepper masala and loves spice. He said it's his new favorite and wants to come back tomorrow. Had really good fried veggies for an appetizer too. Can't wait to come back,5.0,2,2
"While on vacation my girlfriend and I stayed at the motel across the street. We came here because it was close. I wish we would have walked a little further. The staff looked and acted like they hated being there. The guy that took our order was rude. The pizza? Horrible. The sauce was so watery it soaked the bottom crust and made it pastey. We had ordered our pizza with extra cheese which seemed to irritate the guy that took our order for some unknown reason. When we got our pizza it had what I can only describe as a ""screw you!"" amount of extra cheese. I like cheese but this was ridiculous. It was literally a 1/2 inch thick with cheese but very skimpy with the sausage and pepperoni. Every bite seemed to entail 10 minutes of chewing to break up the rubbery cheese so that you could swallow it without gagging. And to top it off my beer was flat. This place was a 100% FAIL!",1.0,0,0
"So, this is not a fast food place, but having forgotten that a double pork chop takes a bit longer to suffer its eminent and inevitable culinary demise, I became impatient as I sat waiting, sipping my diet coke. 

Every minute passing my thoughts raced: ""This better be good"". Then, a huge beast of a bald headed man, escorted by a petite assistant, was Chef Isaac and Pauly. They carefully carried my double pig chop, goat thighs with cornbread and dirty rice straight away and the wait was indeed worth every minute.",5.0,2,2
"This review reflects some of the staff and only the vegan burritos. Not all because ultimately our waiter was awesome. When we arrived the hostess informed our part my of 7 had to wait until they had enough servers. She then called another hostess to offer us to sit and wait in the bar. We did because of how they made us feel when we said we didn't want our grandchildren waiting in a bar. Then we asked for seating inside not including the covered patio. Again that person wasn't happy with us as shown by her rolling eyes and purses lips. (Older lady with heavy accent). Yes. We actually saw her eyes roll... Wow! 30 minutes later than five if they had told us we would be waiting we were finally seated... In the covered patio area which we had specifically said we did not want to eat in because it is Tucson and it is 105° outside! Rather than cause more eyeballs rolling we decided to except the patio at least until my son had to kill flies. Of course he had nothing else but the rolled up  menu to kill them with because they were surrounding our table and running all over us. Gross! Add to that the exterior windows of the covered patio were kept open so all of the air conditioning was going out the windows and left us in the most humid, hot and nasty muggy environment I've ever had to deal with.  I finally decided to risk even worse service and maybe even food with additives like the dead flies that we had to deal with and I asked to be moved to the inside of the restaurant which is what we had originally requested... Lo and behold that same woman's eyeballs were really but guess what? It took two minutes to get it inside on it to clean table with no flies an actual air conditioning.
Now we had a better server whose eyeballs did not roll in the back of his head when we mentioned that we were vegan. He was a very nice young man and did all he could to help us. Unfortunately the vegan burrito that promised vegetables on the inside was mostly a large flower Dorthea rolled over and over so it was a six Dorthea and inside of that was more of the side beans that we already had on our plate. I guess they consider beans to be vegetables. 

Inexcusable eyeball rolling should have made me leave. Beans and tortilla as a vegetable-burro is wrong. Oh well... 

Still, thank you to the waiter we ultimately had. He was very nice and cordial. 




Update: 10/20/18 RUDE RUDE RUDE!! I keep coming back and trying. But clearly this is a place that does NOT value customers unless they are the ""right"" ones! 

Walked out as soon as we were seated when we asked if they had a vegan menu. ""Vegan menu? It's on your menu! Everywhere!""  Really??? Everywhere? Cuz most of it says chicken/beef:pork/cheese. Wow. Si no eres Blanco, Texas tratan mal",1.0,0,0
"Beware of any blended fruit drinks that are made with non-organic fruits, or fruits grown with pesticides.  It takes a lot to make a drink and you end up consuming a ton of this additive.

"I tried.  I remember going to the Jerk Hut years agoa.  I didn't like it, but I thought it was my lack of experience with carribean fare.  I remember the food being way too spicy and I like spicy. I remember the chicken being tough. So, let's get to the present, I had a groupon/living social deal and said, ""Yes, I will try it again!""  Get there and order. I notice the food is expensive, no worries, I will pay for good food. We were getting our food to go, so we sit and sit and sit.  Not sure why, but we sit. I get a chicken pattie to help me sit.  The cashier wasn't nice or mean, she just didn't care. She never acknowledge how long we were sitting, nothing.  No worries, good food chumps that any day, especially when it's to go. The food finally comes. Ox tails, peas and rice and cabbage. YEAH! Get it home and it was not good at all.  So many painful memories come to mind and I am left kicking myself for even going back.

"My son and I went to Underground on Monday (12/29/14) with my soon to be 18 year old son to consult with an artist about his first tattoo. A pretty big deal to my son, right?!  Unfortunately, we were met with a very dismissive man/artist who was more interested in kissing his girlfriend and placating her dinner needs.  He said he could not schedule an appointment with any artists on Friday (01/02/15), he did not want to look at my son's pic of his potential tattoo and he told us to, ""Show up Friday and we will get you in to see someone at some time.""  My son was disappointed as he was hoping to get some design input and schedule an appointment.  He left, but I stuck around to look at some flash.  While doing so, two girls came into the shop wanting matching tattoos. Not only did this man gave them is undivided attention and agree to look at their pics... consult about design...he agreed to them right then, right there?!?  If an artist doesn't respect for myself/my son to have a (maybe) ten minute conversation about his first tattoo...how can we trust that artist to take the time to ensure a quality tattoo?  Good for us, we quickly learned of the unprofessionalism of this place before permanent damage was done.  Too bad for them, I was prepared to pay $400.00 for my son's first tattoo.  Oh well, we went to another reputable shop in Edwardsville where we were taken seriously, treated with respect and tattoo appointment is scheduled!!",1.0,0,0
I've been going to this liquor store for 5 years now and have never recieved bad service until today. I was waiting in line and the girl in front of me needed help finding italian wine. That would have been fine but the cashier took off for approx 1min without excusing herself before i decided to get in the other line. When she came back she never invited me first into her till but instead everyone in front of me. So then i get to the till clerk and he tries charging me $45 for a $17 bottle of wine....

Bad: (Well not so bad), staff. The staff is young, typically inexperienced and its a sports bar/ chain.

Be attentive and active with your staff but not a sourpuss and the will gladly work with you.

My experience: I come here every so often and know what to expect. The food is decent and if you get there at the right time can be cheap. Pizza, finger foods and dishes are good.

So, I called Florida Shell Shop and described some of the items we had purchased over the phone.  The gentleman found the things I was describing quickly and is shipping them to my house!

The atmosphere was pleasant and inviting.  Cleanliness was very great..... so likely this store would be a go to place for me.  

Im vegan, so thai tends to be my go to food when eating out.   My Paradise noodle with tofu was delivered cold...the broccoli, tofu and sauce was too cold to eat...  when discussed with our server it was taken care of immediately...unfortunately the fix appeared to be reheating the dish.  Not a bad solution, but some of the vegetables came back overcooked. Very tasty, but over cook.  
Additionally, the flat noodles in this dish were mostly missing.  Which is odd...  

The second entree was the Massamma curry.  Maybe a tad too watery.  Very tasty. But could have been thickened

"5 stars all around! No wonder Cafe La Maude has such rave reviews, they deserve every single one. My husband and I came for a New Years Day hungover brunch and it seemed like the rest of Philly was doing the same. It is a very tastefully decorated intimate cafe that turns tables around with impressive speed. When we arrived, there were maybe 4 other parties ahead of us, all standing closely at the entrance to not have to wait in the frigid cold. Within less than 15 minutes we were seated and promptly served. They are BYOB and have delicious fresh squeezed orange juice for mimosas. 

Being the big eaters we are, we started with the parfait and espresso/americano. I don't know that a parfait is ever something memorable, but this one will linger in our hearts and stomachs for a long time. The creamiest yogurt topped with strawberries, banana, and tasty chunks of homemade granola. It was a very generous portion and could definitely be eaten alone by one person, so I'm glad we shared it before our entrees! I ordered the sweet potato Benedict and an order of French toast and unfortunately I cannot remember what my husband ordered. I'm so happy so many other Yelpers have taken pictures because I regret not doing so with these beautiful dishes!! We were so hungry that we dove right in to enjoy our meals. 

I'm not exactly sure, but I get the vibe that the menu is a fusion of Middle Eastern and French cuisine, two of my favorites. I'm biased coming from a Turkish family, but the combinations of dishes on this menu were so interesting that we cannot wait to come back and try everything. What sold me on the sweet potato benny, other than being a fan of any sort of Benedict, was that it was served with Sujuk, a spicy breakfast sausage my dad would always bring home from the Turkish market. It's not something you see many places and I was excited to see it included in a few other dishes as well. What an incredible meal... the perfect medley of flavors harmoniously mixed. My husband was blown away by his meal as well. I saved about half of my benny in order to still have room for the beautiful French toast we also ordered. To no surprise, the French toast was perfectly prepared and beautifully served with fresh fruit. 

Something we loved was how involved the owner was in his cafe. He was keeping track of waiting parties, kept tables moving, ran food, and was extremely personable with all his guests. His love for his business showed and he should be very proud of this amazing gem in Northern Liberties. We're already planning our next visit! What a great way for us to start 2018!",5.0,2,2

"How bad is the service at Great West Chrysler? I bought a new 2014 Ram 1500 Sport from them last August and I received free lifetime oil changes. After a few times getting my oil changed there, some DBag ""Service Writer"" started hassling me to get my 25,000 km ""service done for $250.... No thank you I said. He then went on to tell me that if I don't get it done, it could void my warranty.... Excuse me? The ""service"" they wanted to do included things like, checking me tire pressure, tire rotation was the big ticket item.... Fill my washer fluid and things like that... Noooo, I do that stuff myself and HELL NO, it won't void my warranty. I now willing pay for my oil change at Jiffy Lube

Before I bought my new truck, I took my 05 1500 in for some needed repairs. I knew I was gonna spend a few bucks, but another DBag ""service writer"" told me I had a bent axel shaft and the pinion seal was gone, along with the axel bearing.... Like I said, I knew it was gonna be pricey... DBag tried to tell me that they'll only do BOTH axel shafts, cuz that how they do it. After I'd picked myself up off the floor from laughing at him, I told the ""service writer"", that line of BS MAY work on someone else, but just do the work it needs and I advised him that I'll be inspecting the invoice very carefully when I pick my truck up... Please keep in mind, I have ZERO issues with the mechanics that do the work there, but unfortunately, you have to go through a bunch of lying, scamming, conniving, manipulating a**holes to get to them. Long story short, when I picked my truck up a few days later, the invoice was for $4500... WTF??? After a careful inspection of the bill, the useless c**ksucker tried to bill me for the OTHER axel shaft that the DID NOT install AND he tried to Bill the pinion seal as a separate job... 4 hours for a part that was changed as part of doing the one axel shaft. By the time I was done with him, my ""invoice"" was just under $1900. In other words, they tried to charge me $2600 for work they DID NOT DO. Don't even get me started on how they treated my wife with her vehicle. That when I really lost it on them... 

NEVER take your vehicle to them... Unless you're stupid and rich and don't care how much money you get scammed out of.

"So last week I went to K & Co. Jewelers for the first time. WOW, the event was watches and whiskey, had an amazing time. I'm a huge watch guy and whiskies but I've never been to a place where every piece of jewelry or watch you looked at had a story. I mean to know your product so well and to know it's back story blew me away. If you're looking for a watch or a very nice piece of jewelry for your better half you HAVE to check these guys out first. I just moved to Brentwood and may not know a lot but I moved from San Francisco where there are so many options and this family owned business puts their customers first. It's a nice change from the high pressure places I've been before.  They have a huge selection of higher end items but also reasonable items for the everyday ""just because"" gifts some of us men give. Thank you Richard for bringing a great business back to Brentwood.",5.0,2,0
"My husband and I chose to have our July 2011 wedding ceremony on the beach directly behind the Cabrillo Pavilion Arts Center and our reception in the Arts Center.  The ceremony on the beach was perfect and we had no issue accommodating 130 guests.  Although the beach is public, people were very respectful of the fact a ceremony was underway and we had no issues with noise or people randomly walking by the ceremony location.  Our cocktail hour was held upstairs in the Arts Center in the back section with all the windows overlooking the beautiful Pacific Ocean, as well as on the amazing balconies.  We had so many compliments on the venue.  The word ""amazing"" was commonly used by our guests.  The main room used for the reception comfortably fit all our guests, the dance floor and buffet tables.  We opted to drape the walls with fabric to soften the room and that really transformed it.  It really was very beautiful.  This location is very reasonably priced for the space, location and amazing views.  Our guests have commented on the Cabrillo months after our wedding.  I worked primarily with Leslie Lund who was so great to work with in the months leading up to our big event.  I highly recommend this hidden gem if you are considering a Santa Barbara wedding and want a view that will amaze your guests.     

Other vendors that we used that we also loved and would highly recommend include: Grass Roots Florist, LBPS (lighting & fabric design), Gavin Roy (DJ), Robert Boyd (guitarist for ceremony) and Blue Horizon Studios (photography).",5.0,2,2
"My first, and last, Hooters experience is best, and only, described as a colossal waste of time. Our waitress was an absolutely abysmal waitress and should be deprived of her responsibilities immediately.

After waiting nearly 90 minutes to be seated, our table was given to us without utensils and we were forced to wait for water. When we finally ordered our food, we were met with a further excessive waiting time. Appetizers meant to be shared for the table came without plates, making such sharing difficult. Multiple requests for plates were ignored. Only half of the ordered quantity of wings came, and an order of tacos arrived nearly an hour after the rest of the food. When the plates finally arrived, they were visibly dirty, as if they had been taken from a table and brought to us without being washed. The wings were fine, nothing special, but my buddy Robbie said his burger was ""solid.""

From the long wait time, to the lack of cleanliness and the errors in the food we received, our time at Hooters gave little (to no) reason to hoot. I will not be returning, and am still sitting here waiting for the check, having asked nearly 15 minutes ago.",1.0,0,0

Come June when the weather is extremely hot I call to get it looked at again for a third time and they do not have anything for a month out.

In all honesty I wish I could give this place no stars. This was one of the worst experiences I've had in New Hope. Don't be deceived by the outside patio. I instantly got turned off by how the main waitress (older woman) aggressively wanted is to order immediately. Then she brought a pitcher of water that was filthy. The poppers came out frozen. We had to ask for them to be redone. They refried the same ones. Then a grilled chicken Caesar salad came out 30 minutes after everyone else's food. When we said we didn't want it anymore the same older woman argued that that's how long chicken takes to cook. When our check came they added over $20 for no reason. Save yourself the headache and don't go here.,1.0,0,0
"I guess it's my own fault.  ""Don't order it,"" admonished Husband. ""It's just unnatural, and you know it. Don't do it."" But it was the fifth stop on the Whiskey Hunt, and damnit, nothing sounded better to soak up all that whiskey than a nice schnitzel with spaetzle. Even if it was CHICKEN schnitzel.  But as it turned out, Husband was right...chicken schnitzel? Just wrong.  Give me my piggie.  The chicken wasn't the only problem, though. The plating was atrocious, with one sad miniscule leaf of spinach to represent the third promised side. See my photo; it was taken before I touched the food. All around, a disappointing meal for me.

With the poor quality of my dish, I really can't go above three stars, even though there were some much better choices made by my party.  Friend raved over his Grilled Lamb Brochette, and Husband was infatuated with the Serrano Ham appetizer that was incredibly delicious and was enough to share, which was good, since his second order, the Basque Beef Tongue, did not get fulfilled...they ran out.  Our server was fantastic...we warned her in advance that we were deep in our cups, and she took it with good humor and treated us well.

So even though our visit here was basically a success--we had a good time all around and enjoyed our Jefferson's Reserve--food-wise, there were just too many disappointments for a restaurant of this caliber.",3.0,1,1

"It's bad enough I had to call 911 and have my husband taken to the hospital, it's even worse that I can't visit him. I know it's internal bleeding. I know it's the weekend, but he hadn't eaten anything all day Thursday because he didn't feel well. Of course ER wouldn't give him food on Friday as he would probably need tests. He was then moved to a room was monitored all day Saturday ( with no food). Finally on Sunday Dr Pert finally makes it to see him after 5pm.  That's 3 days with no food, but Monday is an endoscopy so no food. They woke him to move his room at 1am. Monday at noon he gets the test done. They want him to stay another night to be monitored. He asks if he can finally have food on Monday night. An hour and a half later, someone comes in to collect trays. He explains that he NEVER got his food. The nurse then says that she couldn't get ahold of the cafeteria!! Screw this lack of care!

I used to cut my own hair for 15 years before retiring from the Army but the $15 charge for a regular cut isn't too bad.

Service was good not pushy. 

I had a burger which was well cooked pretty tasty and not too expensive. My dining partner had a Salmon Nicoise salad which was the size of a house - more a full dinner than a subtle salad. 

All in all a reasonable tasty experience. Not fine dining but a pretty decent place to stumble upon. There menus were a little tatty and not up to date when it came to the beers on offer.

"What a wonderful place! 

My experiences leave me with a smile as I walk out the door. First experience was an adult birthday party dinner. I wanted to surprise my friend with a pirate themed birthday dinner. Birthday girl made the reservation, I brought the surprise theme. I was so shocked how excited The Wylder was to help us with our surprise fun. I called to make sure it was ok because first impression (because it is so clean and hip there) is they would not want us/help us to celebrate. OPPOSITE, they were ecstatic to hear my plans and help. I brought in a cake, candles, party necklaces, party table decorations, eye patches for all, and a huge annoying pirate hat for the bday girl. I dropped off the bday goodies to them early and when we arrived for dinner the party, the table was all ready! Bday girl was pumped, so were we!

In addition to them being so fun about pirate party, service was perfect! Our server was attentive, fun, patient, and on top of it. Mushroom toast - get it, Housemade ricotta - amazing yum, yum (those house preserves are to die for), Honey Badger - duh - amazing, Bronco - amazing too, Yaya's house - yum to our tum, The Wylder chopped - perfect and super shareable between 2-3 people! Honestly, I am guessing you can't go wrong with anything here. (Dipping sauce - do it!!)

Because I had such a great experience at our pirate bday party, I had to bring my parents to try the food and experience the great service. No surprise, excellent experience and my parents had fun and left happy, like me! 

Yes, this is a bit spendy for pizza but know a pizza can easily be split between 2 people, maybe 3 depending on how much food you eat. We split the chopped salad and two pizzas and we left stuffed and with leftovers. Honestly, my parents and I could have split a pizza between ourselves but because the pizza is amazing, we ate more than we probably needed.

"Ok, so the food was AH-MAZING! Drinks were large and delish, but the service was, um, yikes! I went to an early dinner with my friend on a Friday afternoon before happy hour and there were about 10 people there, so not crowded. We sat at the bar and weren't greeted for about 2 minutes even though there 4 bartenders all huddled up talking right in front of us. Seriously, we sat there while they all gossiped about this and that before finally turning around and acknowledging our presence.

We ordered our drinks and they were quick and yum! After that, it took over 10 minutes for us to get any service again. Our original bartender ignored us, while others just talked to one patron while completely ignoring new one and us. After staring around the joint for what feel like forever, we were finally acknowledged and someone took our order.

Whew, ok, after we ordered, about 4 parties received their food before us, even though we ordered less! It took about 20 minutes for the food to come out. Now, if this were a fancy establishment where you're seated at the front I wouldn't have a problem. It's Friday, I get it, but it's a fast casual place, quick is their thing. Being at a restaurant for over an hour WITHOUT that being our choice is a tad ridiculous, especially when you're marketing yourself as a quick.

Since I don't live in Franklin, I probably won't come back. The food was good and is what saved this review from being 1 star, but the service was atrocious. You can find good tacos with better service at numerous places in the greater Nashville area. I'd recommend seeking one of them out.",3.0,1,1

"I cannot begin to express how much I dislike living here.  The only reason I am still living here is because my job is 3 mins away and my son's school was close too.  My lease is up in March and I cannot wait.  

1. Management office- Daniele and Iris are great, the rest of the staff is nasty and unprofessional.  They do not know how to speak to tenants.  They are quick to scold you on what you're not doing properly but they lack resolving tenant issues.  

2.  The lack of organization when they make changes in the community.  They had the parking lot repainted, mind you they didn't even fix it just repainted the lines.  Well this took place for about 2 weeks.  Left us with little to no parking and towed cars during this process.  


3.  The rent you pay is not worth living here.  They do not maintain the buildings.  There is bat crap, dead insects, and dirty floors.   They should be maintaining  the grounds according to what they promote ""luxury living"".   What a joke.  There is not sufficient lighting by the mailboxes.   The pool hall (billiards) smells like urine, the garbage in the common areas are not emptied enough,  they are spilling over.  Disgusting.  

If you need a place for a short term then this will be ok.  But this is not a place you want to stay for long.  

I cannot wait to move out of here.  Please feel free to contact me as I have many more examples, I just don't want to post them publicly.  

And if a member of management is reading this.   Shame on you for promoting a certain way of living.  This place is a complete rip off.  Answer your tenants emails and calls.  Don't wait till they publicly call you out. Especially a tenant who pays their rent, and Follows all the senseless rules.  It is important that you keep your word and provide the quality of living you promote.",1.0,0,0

We sent it back to the kitchen and they cut it up, but the meat was very tough. we also got a rib feast (ribs, two sides, a pound of meat). The chicken was good, but the ribs were very dry and tough. The corn was very dry and I had to ask for butter and put salt and pepper on it The macaroni and cheese was very bland and dry . Just noodles with some cheese.

"This should really be a 5 star and I'm sure when I go back I'll re-visit my review, but I have a cold and couldn't taste very much, so I'm giving it a 4 based on everyone else raving about it and me enjoying myself thoroughly despite the 90 degree morning!

We got there 20 minutes after they opened so we got Rock Star parking right inside the gates near the temple. Otherwise you have to start parking across the street pretty quickly, but it's not a huge inconvenience out here. 

Then, we didn't know the lay of the land and therefore we missed knowing about all the desserts, fresh summer rolls and curry station until AFTER we'd picked out our other foods from the back deck and down by the flower stand. Too late. So, next time we'll wander the entire porch first. It seemed a bit overwhelming at first so my suggestion is to take your time to peruse the fixings--but not TOO long. The line for noodle soup was long, but fast. 

Too hot for soup for me so I went to look elsewhere and found chicken and pork satay down under a tent by the orchids. Also, bags of sticky rice! Then, we found a table with friends we ran across that were already rattling and got to try their summer rolls-shrimp with peanut sauce was great! And cold beef salad! For not being able to taste much, that salad had cilantro and was spicy so I loved it!

We did miss out on coconut custard-silly us, we waited to get it till we were done with lunch and it was sold out-hour wait. Next time!

We went into the temple and reveled in the beauty for awhile before purchasing an orchid and getting out of the heat! Can't WAIT to go back!!",4.0,2,0

I don't know if this place lives up to the hype it's received from its trendy social media posts. Not much has changed from the physical appeal of King's Street food counter besides the color scheme and the addition of some flamingos. Also with the vibrant brunch scene in St. Pete I am surprised they don't do Saturday brunch only Sunday. I thought the drinks were average at best. The food was pretty good. The drinks were a 3 and the food was a 5 so that's how I decided on the 4 star rating. The lobster melt was delicious and the Cuban was pretty good as well.

Second, it wasn't that amazing. It was average BBQ. Sure, it was good, but I was really expecting something amazing. We also had the baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad - all average. Also tried fried corn on the cob (because of the reviews) and didn't care for it at all.

"This was date night for us last night and I have to say I was impressed by the relative newcomer to the St. Louis pizza scene. We started off with a very tasty pear salad, which I highly recommend (definitely have the waiter sprinkle pepper onto the salad). The Fantasy pizza truly does live to its name. The burrata cheese was incredibly creamy and the prosciutto was excellent. However, the real winners of the pizza were the sauce and the crust. The sauce was, hands down, my favorite in St. Louis. Perfectly salted and top-quality. And the crust was also fantastic, as it magnificently achieved the perfect balance of crispy to chewy. We also had the tiramisu for dessert and enjoyed that as well. 

That all being said, the pizzas are slightly larger than a ""personal"" size, which is perfectly paired with a salad for a light dinner for two. However, if you're especially hungry, I'd recommend getting two of the pizzas. All in all, I really enjoyed the charm of this restaurant and look forward to coming back.",5.0,2,2

"Reading Terminal Markets offers so many delicious things to eat and purchase.  I love coming on the weekends for lunch and having my choice of gyros, roast pork, breakfast sandwiches, and some of the most delightful donuts in this city.  It is true that on the weekends the crowds can be crazy and it can be hard to walk through the aisles and browse, but if you know where you're going you can go in one of the exterior doors nearest your destination and cut out some of the hassle.  

Olympic Gyro makes awesome gyros (go for the platter and you get a heaping Greek salad on the side!), Beiler's Donuts are cream-filled gluttony (the banana is an old standard, and don't miss the banana ice cream at Bassett's-best banana ice cream EVER).  DiNic's is a classic and draws huge crowds of tourists and locals alike but I tend to skip the lines in favor of Olympic because you can pretty much always get a seat right away. 

 Also the Amish diner counter slings breakfast foods insanely fast- you've barely finished ordering and they already are putting plates down in front of you!  Very standard fare but worth it in a time crunch.

Also The Tubby Olive, a little shop that sells flavored olive oils and vinegars, is a great place to get a hostess/mom gift and they have tons of different styles and flavors that you can try in the shop.  A little pricey for olive oil and vinegar but a fun gift idea for someone who likes to cook/make salads.  

Also Reading Terminal Market is super conveniently located in Center City so it's perfect in the middle of a day on the town.  Watch out on Sundays though because many of the Amish shops are closed and you can't have any donuts :(.",4.0,2,2

"We had an issue with my engagement ring and went into the store with little hope of a resolution. We dealt with the manager Renee who did everything in her power to help us out. While we were getting things settled she reassured us it would be ok as well as informing us of benefits that Jared offers that we were not taking advantage of. With little to no knowledge of jewelry she also educated us on basic things to look for when purchasing. We enjoyed our experience and the following week when it was time to pick up the ring it was ready hours before the estimated pick up time and the resizing was perfect and the ring looked like new. 

I'm a little disappointed with Jared because the ring that was ordered online I believe was made with faulty craftsmanship but the Jared in Wilmington did what they could to rectify that.",4.0,2,2

"I agree with the review that stated ""expectations were too high"". 
Let me preface this by saying, yes, it is a VERY nice grocery, etc. If you live in the vicinity, or close enough, then this should be your store. I, however, live a bit of a drive, so unless I'm back around that area, I'm not going back. That's due to not just the store, but the headaches it takes to get there. i.e. TRAFFIC...sheesh. When Carmel gets their ""city planning"" done, I'm more likely to frequent.
Now, the store itself is beautifully laid out. The selections of cheeses, meats, etc. that you've read are just that, in abundance. The staff is VERY friendly. Pre-made dishes are also in abundance, and are not your average pre-made types. Everything from fresh made tabbouleh, to homemade turkey meatballs, sandwiches, on and on. Very nice. 
Being a Giant Eagle fan, I was pleased to see some offerings you don't normally see around here. Some Pittsburgh faves, i.e. certain types of Pierogies, and chip chop ham! 
The only downfall is what I've stated, and the wine/beer selection. Heard a LOT about how great it is, but honestly, Kahns, and really several other places have a much better selection and are closer to me. 
So, if you're up for a challenge in traffic, or live close by, do yourself a favor and check this place out, at least once er twice.",3.0,1,1

"I wish I could give 6 stars.

I recently bought an older bike from a friend. After the first use, the front brakes went bad. It was a Sunday, and I tried the only shop in St. Louis I knew was open. They were going to charge me over $85, and I honestly felt I was being take advantage of for being a beginner. The shop worker was a bit condescending (not on purpose) and charged me $15 for looking at my bike and tightening one bolt (without my approval). I paid the $15 and left because I didn't feel it would take nearly $85 to fix one single stripped nut on my brake.

So I went to Bike Works a few days later. It took 15 minutes, and for HALF the price I was going to have to pay at the other shop, I not only got the brake fixed but I also got a helmet, a bell, AND a water bottle holder. I never once felt shamed or taken advantage of for being a beginner here. Bike Words is supreme. Period.",5.0,2,2

I would say the fajita quesidilla wqs the best I have ever had.  I have had this at many other places but here everything just seemed fresher.  The menu has all the classic mexican dishes as well as some standard american fair.  This is not chain and not one of those places that gives you a ton of food on tje cheap.

"One of the best spin/high intensity fitness studios I've found.

I travel a decent bit for work, so I'm always looking for a great, locally-owned group fitness studio in different cities. And when you come to Nashville - where the superb Southern cuisine is not shy on calories - finding a great work out is clutch. Tylt offers the best spin equipment in the game - the bike actually rotates right and left (simulating a real road bike), and works both your balance and core strength/stability.

Off the bike, there is circuit training involving a blend of free weights, mats, resistance bands, and TRX. You rotate stations (7-8 min per) until you hit all of them.

Finally, Paige is a rockstar instructor/hype girl. She clearly knows what she's doing, isn't short on enthusiasm, and delivers one hell of a workout. Added perk for Yelp users - if you check in, they add a class to your account.",5.0,2,2

He's very courteous and spoke great english, he told us what the specials were and gave a better experience than the previous two times we were here.

Had a chance to have lunch here last Friday. If you're looking for terrific food in a beautiful setting then this is your place. Service was spot on. Portions were very generous for the price. Variety was key here as there was something for all taste buds. If looking for a nice lunch give them a try. I would imagine a romantic dinner would work as well with their beautiful rooftop deck.,5.0,2,2
"Came here for lunch while we were in town for a conference.  I'm not sure how this place gets 5 stars.

It's a whole-in-the-wall Greek place.  Walked in and was greeted by an overly nervous waitress (I assume she was new).  We sat down and ordered.   Both of us got the gyros but there was absolutely nothing special about them.  Generic gyro meat on a generic pita with generic tzatziki sauce on the side . I don't know about you, but I prefer my tzatziki to be thin and creamy, theirs was the consistency of sour cream.

Anyways, don't bother.  Find another Greek place in town if you're dying for Greek.",2.0,0,1
"So nice we ate there twice! Great service, handmade latte mugs so beautiful I bought one, and good food! I wasn't FLOORED by it, but it was really good. A little on the pricey side but what can you expect from a restaurant in an upscale hotel? The biscuit bar was good, the grits were some of the best I've had. I would A- for food, but A++ for service and atmosphere! The first day it came to light that our server Meagan and I shared a birthday, and later that day she had some local chocolates and handmade marshmallows sent to our room with a super sweet note. That was easily the sweetest (no pun intended) most thoughtful thing a hospitality worker has ever done! Would stay and eat here again, and I love having my morning lattes at home from the handmade mug.",4.0,2,2

Always enjoyed dining here. Nice friendly atmosphere. Great to see them extend complimentary dinner on Veteran's Day. Our favorite place to go for steaks. Only complaint is the customers who allow their children to run wild. Not safe for servers carrying hot food. They seem afraid to ask people to control their kids.

This was my frist time dinning at this restaurant. My experience was not satisfactory. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. My food was not what I expected from such a well known restaurant. The decor was beautiful. But my food was terrible. My chicken was burned around the edges to the point that it was inedible. The sauce was nasty.

Two stars because food was fresh, hot, and right-sized portions, and place was clean. You might like it though so don't be afraid to try it.

"I wish I liked this place more. I see the appeal - small, independent, family owned, eclectic. But I feel like raving about this place is a little pretentious.

Also, they close sometimes, unexpectedly. I know we're supposed to be anti-corporate, but I still want quality (and this place isn't any cheaper than the Ritz). I will say that the service is great and the crowd is very respectful. It's also near the Square, where there are no other movie theaters (unless you count ""adult film"").

Although the atmosphere wasn't my favorite, I had the buffalo cauliflower and I thought it tasted great. My only complaint is that I wish it was already tossed in the buffalo sauce since instead I had to dip into it and they are pretty big pieces. Since this place is so close to my job I would like to try it again, the next time I'll be getting one of those delicious looking burgers.

"I have passed by this store on my bus ride home for several years. I have always been interested in going inside to look around and purchase personal items because reviews said the store was helpful and professional, but was honestly very embarrassed and never had the time. I finally got the nerve to go inside today, and will never do it again. Inside the small store were two employees and a couple shopping for personal devices which one employee was showing them. When I entered, the unoccupied employee came up to me and asked to hold my shopping bag from a previous store while I shopped. I complied willingly with the fair request, recognizing its loss prevention value. Both employees, though busy with other tasks, continued to periodically look over at me as I looked around, though I gave it no notice at the time. I looked around for about ten minutes, wanting mostly to be undisturbed as I still felt embarrassed to be there. Deciding on an item I wanted to purchase, I picked up the box and stood around waiting for the previous couple to finish with their purchase, never staying more than 5 feet from the counter. When I came up to the counter to check out, the employee took my credit card information and ID, and then suddenly said she needed a moment and asked her junior associate to watch the desk. She then walked behind a screen just out of view, and proceeded to very loudly talk on the phone to the owner accusing me of shoplifting the item I was trying to purchase, as apparently the seal on the box had been broken. The other couple was still in the store, as were new customers who had walked in after me, and they were clearly listening in on the phone conversation. When the first employee reemerged she said ""You can either turn out your pockets and give back the item you stole, or we can call the police"". I was very angry, mostly out of embarrassment for all of the attention that was being drawn to me, and I indicated to the employees I had not stolen anything, and they confiscated my bag when I entered the store, but they insisted it was in my pockets. Embarrassed and upset, I turned put all of my empty pockets, and when they continued to insist I had the item I asked them to call the police as I hadn't stolen anything and asked them to check the security camera. The employee disappeared again to ""call the owner"", and I asked the other employee why I would attempt to pay for an item I had stolen to which she had no response. Eventually, the first employee returned and had the nerve to say this was ""very upsetting"" for them, and that this course of action was the result of explicit instructions from the owner on how to handle situations like this. This should have been a misunderstanding, but because the owner's innappropropriate and illogical operating protocols, I was humiliated in front of other customers while I was trying to shop for sensitive items. 

I will not shop here again and I will not recommend this store to my friends. I knew I should have just shopped online for the same items and saved myself the embarrassment and unwelcome atmosphere of visiting this store.",1.0,0,1

"Spinelli's Bar Italia is a coffee shop attached to the Italian Centre Shop (or Spinelli's) on 95 St. in Little Italy. Before it's current incarnation it was another cafe called Tra Amici, which was essentially the same but a little bit better. No matter, I still enjoy Bar Italia a lot. It is now owned by the same family that own the store. I generally dislike going to the chain coffee shops to meet up with a friend ($4.50 for a medium hot chocolate - no thanks!), so Bar Italia is my go-to place. It's also only a 5 minute drive from my house, so that's a bonus. 

Bar Italia is a fair size, with about 10 or so tables. They also put a few tables outside in the summer. There are some paintings on the walls of Italy, as well as your standard World Cup/football memorabilia. It is pretty basic as far as decor goes. The thing I love about it here are the prices! Cheap! I don't usually drink coffee, but they have a big selection of coffee, cappucino, esspresso, etc. I usually get tea when I go which is very reasonable at $1.50. A bowl of soup is $3.95, a pannini for $5 or $6 (depending on the size you get), and awesome pastries all around $2ish. The canoli are my favorite, yum! Oh, and don't forget the gelato. 

I've been in here at all times of the day - daytime on the weekend, 8pm on a Tuesday, and it's always busy, sometimes surprisingly so. They have a few TVs up that are always playing soccer (usually on the weekend) or some other sports. I was here a few weekends ago for a few hours and in that time they played a Serie A game, a La Liga game, and one other game. Try to go here during the World Cup or some other big tournament, but get there early! The customers are always varied and interesting - older Italian folks, young folks, families, people taking a break from their shopping. All in all, a very relaxed, inexpensive place to spend some time and catch up with friends or family.",5.0,2,1

"This Frothy Monkey has a great location just off Main Street in downtown Franklin, and they have very good coffee, good food, and generally friendly and helpful service.

I'm normally a ""black coffee"" guy, but I've often tempted by some of the creative specialty coffee drinks they have at Frothy Monkey. My wife also loves the Golden Monkey, which features the flavor of turmeric.

The food is good with quite a bit of variety on the menu. While I always think of a coffee shop as a breakfast place, they do serve lunch and dinner. Every time I've eaten at Frothy Monkey I've been perfectly happy with my food, but it is never so great that I seek it out. In other words, I go for the coffee first and foremost, which they do a great job with.

The service is generally friendly and helpful, though sometimes a little slow. I feel Frothy Monkey is best when you want to chill with your coffee, not when you're in a rush.

"Disclaimer: I am a ""cheapest-haircut-I-can-find-usually-SuperCuts-or-Hair-Cuttery"" kinda girl. My first time here and I loved it...I would love to go back, depending on the prices for a simple wash/cut...

Obviously, I had to jump on a Groupon for b2 Salon. $30 for a conditioning treatment, cut, blow-dry, style...NICE!

First, I have to say that I received wonderful treatment even though I was paying about half price. Groupon says it was valued at $75, (which I could never afford) and the staff was absolutely wonderful! 

I arrived early for my appointment (which I made same day) and they were able to take me as soon as I arrived. The place is clean and hip, with Top 40's pop music as your soundtrack (annoying to me, but probably pleasing to the masses!). 

Seriously, the wash is always the best part of a haircut...worth the extra to have someone else do it and this guy was good. I had an amazing conditioning treatment/scalp massage and after letting it sit for about 5 mins, I was greeted by my stylist, Kayla. 

I'm not one to make drastic changes to my hair, but I've been growing it out from a chin-length bob I've had forever and wanted something new. Kayla listened to all of my requests (""Thin out my weird thick hair!"") and had great ideas along the way for the awkward in-between stage. She chatted me up the entire time, which I LOVED! There is nothing more uncomfortable than a silent haircut session! This girl gave me an awesome cut and is also a Dexter fan. LOVE HER! Honestly, she was so down-to-earth and easy to talk to, it made me instantly trust her suggestions for my cut.

The style turned out great, even better than what I was expecting. In the past, my hair always looks great that day and I can never get it quite the same way as my stylist did. In this case, Kayla cut it so well that my hair falls in a really great way, even when just air drying.

For the $30 groupon, it was a great deal. I probably won't shell out the money to go back for a simple trim, but next time I want a drastic hair change, I'm going back to ask for my girl, Kayla!",4.0,2,2

"The food and drinks taste good and are very reasonably priced, however the staff (especially the manager Chuy) make for an incredibly unpleasant experience.  I was attending this establishment for a company sponsored event for my wife's job. The place was very busy and from the start our server seemed lost and flustered. This was most likely due to the fact that they had her working two separate areas on opposite sides of the building, probably at the order of the inept manager. There were severe delays between the ordering and receiving our food for all members of our party (understandable as they were busy). These were eventually cleared up and everyone received their meal. At the end of of our time we received our check and noticed the math was severely wrong. They had automatically added gratuity (which the only thing notifying you of the policy was a single menu hidden behind the bar). Not a big deal since the server deserved her tip anyway, however, they taxed the check post tip at a rate of over 10% where Tucson sales tax is only 8.1%. When we requested the manager he came out pissed off at us for having the audacity to question his illegal practices. He was rude and had absolutely no business working in the service industry. He immediately showed his lack of intelligence and the competency of a steaming pile of feces. He spent his time talking at us and not once second listening to us as we tried to explain how the check was mistaken. He finally that the illegal over taxing of customers was company policy and that was our bill and we were going to pay it then stomped away with the attitude of a 5 year old girl. This manager deserves to be arrested and jailed for his admitted illegal policies, but at a minimum should be fired for his incompetence.  If it weren't for the lack of service skills of any kind on the part of the useless manager I would probably recommend this place, however I doubt I will ever return, and unless you desire to be treated like a shamed dog, I would recommend you spend your hard earned money somewhere else.",2.0,0,0

I am driving down Busch Blvd and realize that Olive Garden is also running an Endless Pasta special. Yes, Red Lobster is more by $7 but let's be honest, Olive Garden is the person you take to a hotel and Red Lobster is who you take to Red Lobster. At least, that's what Beyonce told me. 

They added Korean BBQ shrimp to the menu. Order that shit. Allow your taste buds to travel to Flavortown. Do order your salad dressing on the side because Red Lobster likes to act like they know the proper salad to dressing ratio. Heads up, they don't. My biggest tip is to consume all food there like you are Guy Ferri. 

I made friends with a lobster in the tank. I hope you guys don't kill him because we are homies.",5.0,2,2

Once you place your order, and if you want to eat at their outdoor dining area, you will have to wait for people to finish their reminiscing and other conversations and then possibly phone calls in order to get a vacant spot. That is, if some entitled person doesn't elbow you out of the way to get around you to get said vacant spot.

Waiting for a seat isn't so bad because you're also waiting for the food to come out too. That might take a bit.

Got Caesar salad, which the greens were crisp but there was about a tbsp of dressing for a large salad.  I actually always order my Caesar salad light on the dressing, but this was so little it actually had no flavour.  At least the greens were good.

The chilli chicken was decent, although what happened to the cucumber and sesame seeds?  What used to be chunks of cucumber is now 3 or 4 paper thin (wilted) slices.  What should be fresh and crunchy is now flaccid and soggy.  Chicken portion was large but it needed balance, not just bulk protein.

Clam chowder.  Yikes.  If you're longing for memories of summer at the beach - this is for you.  Every single bite had sand in it.

"Nice to have something a little more upscale clear up here in north Sparks/Spanish Springs. My wife and I eat there a couple times a month but have noticed service and food quality have been declining steadily. We like the atmosphere and the staff are usually friendly and attentive but we were pretty disappointed last Friday night. 
As they were unusually busy, we opted for dining at the bar since we were really just in the mood for a cocktail and appetizers. The bartender, while friendly, seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with a loaded bar, approximately 10 to 12 customers. Food was brought out fairly quickly but the grilled cauliflower was camouflaged with a lot of croutons on the plate to make it appear to be a generous portion. My big disappointment was the wings. The menu describes the item as ""a pound of wings"" what I received however was 8 of the smallest, most meatless pigeon wings I've ever seen. Several were little more than skin on a bone. 
I could overlook a lot of the little issues with the food and service but 1 appetizer and drink each for two people came to over $62 dollars. After tip we paid for a $70 dollar snack and had to cook up some dinner at home shortly after. 
Hope they pull it back together as we will continue to patronize them.",3.0,1,2

"Went for lunch with family, on a Friday shortly after noon. The place was almost empty. We were seated immediately, menus brought to us, and our waiter arrived shortly thereafter. I ordered shrimp scampi and a bowl of the sausage lentil soup, my mother ordered a steak sandwich, and my brother ordered a pasta dish with shrimp, the name of which I can't remember.

Bread with olive oil for dipping, and drinks, were brought out shortly after our order was placed. The bread was fresh, not amazing, but better than most of the offerings I've had elsewhere.

Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Basically, everyone loved it. 

The scampi was probably the best I've ever had, anywhere; the sauce was thick, buttery, lots of garlic, just the right amount of lemon, not overly complicated. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. I can't imagine how they could have made the dish better, except maybe bigger, and more shrimp, but that's not really a criticism -- considering the price and quality, the portion was reasonable. Oh, and there was more than enough sauce. The scampi came with bread of its own, and maybe there could have been a little more of it to sop up that sauce, but I'm sure if I'd asked they'd have given me more.

The lentil-sausage soup was also great. Maybe a little thin, but the broth was not disappointing. The cups are large, and I hear the bowls are huge; I might go with a bowl next time though, since being a little thin, it wasn't as filling as I expected.

My brother was very happy with his pasta, said it seemed freshly made, and he felt the same way about his shrimp as I did about mine. My mother didn't comment much about her sandwich, but she did say she enjoyed it.

Last, but not least, our server was amazing, attentive and pleasant. Things might be somewhat different if the place was packed, but the service we got was about as much as I could ask for. 

I know I'll definitely be back. Everything was amazing, and the prices were very reasonable.",5.0,2,1

I understand the theme has changed.  This used to be a Lebanese-ran business with pretty good Mediterranean food, but now some SE Asians run the place.  All of the grocery items are Asian now, and the food in the back is Thai and Vietnamese.  Curiously, La Chica and I rolled up in here to see what was going on and hopefully get some pho, but it wasn't meant to be.  They only make pho once in a while as a special, so I ordered up some pad Thai instead.  The price was good at $8 and the taste was even better.  Served on a large banana leaf, the noodles were piled high, lots of egg and sprouts and peanuts on the side.  Only thing lacking was chicken.  Mine had only 5 or 6 small poultry morsels.  However, La Chica's dish, the name of which I don't recall, was chicken-laden, so I think she got some of mine.  But besides that, I walked away stuffed and satisfied.

While we were there, the owner gave us some free samples of their Thai tea and curry.  These too were excellent, and resulted in us getting two teas to go!",4.0,2,1

The special pizza of rock shrimp with lots of spice and arugula had amazing flavor combinations but was difficult to eat because the pizza wasn't thick enough to support the shrimp.

"I work super close by to Jimbo's and crave it often! 

The rolls:
My go-to order is a lunch special with the vegetable roll and crunch crab with soup. The vegetable rolls are wonderfully flavorful with pickled radish and other yummy goodness. The crunch crab is savory and sweet all at once with plenty of surimi and eel sauce with sweet crunchy bits on top. I have ordered the California roll before as well and found it underwhelming. 

The space:
Jimbo's is teeny tiny, as many arcade restaurants are. They're redone their space so that the sushi bar is bigger. I like it, but it can get crowded at peak lunchtime. I don't mind this; I normally end up chatting with whoever else is waiting on sushi! A TV in the corner is always playing some Korean singing TV show (King of Masked Singer, Kpop Star, etc). They're thoroughly entertaining if you get stuck in a long wait despite not having subtitles.

The service:
I'm always impressed with how quickly they move for how small their staff appears to be. I've maybe had to wait 10 minutes tops for sushi before, but that was only when the place was beyond packed at peak lunch hour. When it's busy, the woman at the register will fly through orders to keep the line moving. This can seem unfriendly, but its really just efficient. She's super nice and friendly if you catch them in a slower moment!

All in all: Choose wisely and you will not be disappointed!",5.0,2,2

"I have never been here. But my oldest son is a fan of their delivery service. When he's ordering, I hop on the bandwagon.

We've probably ordered three or four times from 88 China. And when we order, we get enough for more than one meal.

I've had good: eggrolls, pot stickers and crab Rangoon.

This afternoon, we ordered around 2 p.m., thinking delivery would be in about an hour. Didn't take that long. So, this was kinda like dunch.

We had two HUGE bags of food. Two of the dishes were mine, and they were stupendous:

House Special Fried Rice (I call it 10-ingredient fried rice.) -- A massive container filled with fried rice (but not really that much, because there was so much protein: large shrimp, chicken, pork, beef strips and maybe ham), white onion, green onion and carrots.

I was amazed about the amount of protein in a dish like this, and it made me happy. A delightful flavor-fest.

Garlic Chicken -- Another massive container. The dish contained (everything in pretty large pieces) broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots, white onion, huge amounts of chicken, green pepper and bamboo shoots in a rich, sesame seed brown sauce.

I did not taste a lot of garlic, but I really do like garlic, so could have used a bit more.

This dish was so well-balanced, and all the flavors held their own to stand out.

Also had an old pinky ring that belonged to my Father. I no longer wore it because every three months or so the stone would fall out. I was tired of buying cheap plastic stones and having them glued in only to have to do the same thing three months later. I brought the ring to Ray's and explained the situation.

"As a long-time former Kohl's employee (not this location) I know how stores are suppose to be run and look.  I can't help it, I still notice these things when I shop.  I still hear the conversations between employees and managers when I walk by them.... This store's E3 should be ASHAMED.  

I'm disabled and walk with a cane (hence why I no longer work retail...) and I can barely squeeze past the racks because they are too close together, there is fallen clothing that hasn't been picked up that I am constantly tripping over.  It's a hazard.  

The racks themselves are completely unshoppable.  The items are so jam packed onto the racks that you can hardly see what is on them let alone pull a hanger off of them, which is probably why there is so much clothing on the floor.  

NONE of the clothing sizes actually match the sizes or designers of the hangers, which means your recovery teams are being really lazy and just throwing anything on any hanger and the department supervisors don't even care.  

Saw something in the women's section, a JLO sweater and fell in love with it, only to find out that it was actually a misses size.  It would be one thing if a customer had put something back in the wrong spot.... but it was pretty obvious that an employee had just stuck a whole entire rack of sweaters in the wrong department.  That's just being lazy.  I'm actually between sizes, the misses sweater probably would have fit me, but anyone else that came along... probably not.  And I've been there.  It's heartbreaking.  I just left at that point.  (If you read my review for Burlington Coat Factory.... you can see where I went after, and how much I spent at another store.)

We also went in to get a watch battery changed.  Didn't happen.  I worked jewelry at kohls.  The girl didn't have the proper tools and was more worried about her replacement not being there and getting to her next job.  But honestly I felt really bad for her because she was injured and in pain, you could see it on her face and they would not let her leave even though she was suppose to be off the clock and already late for her next job.  (God I'm so glad I don't work for Corporate A$$H0l&$ anymore....)  

And ya know honestly... it would be one thing if this were the first time that this store had been in complete disarray and completely chaotic, but it wasn't.  It isn't.  Every time I go there, it's complete and utter insanity and we've probably been there at least 6 times in the year that we have lived here.  We've honestly started going to the Kohl's in Cherry Hill instead.  At least there I have my favorite restaurants near by, and considering we live in Delran.... it's not that much further of a drive.  

Yall better hope your district or regional manager doesn't decide to just pop in.... sorrynotsorry.",1.0,0,0
"I'd been going here since 1993 almost every friday. 

They have changed either ownership or the cooks or both, because several times in a row the chicken and broccoli was just awful - as in I threw it away and cooked something myself. I had hoped it was just a bit of an off time, but no - it's been bad several times in a row. I""m sad about this.

I'm now looking for another chinese-american place that used to be as good as they were.",2.0,0,0

"What a stunning place. From the front, you'd never know what lies behind the doors of Tampa's Oxford Exchange.  It's truly too much to take in at once; repeat visits are necessary.  The thought that went into the design, the merchandising and the restaurant and cafes set the bar high, and hopefully they will continue to excel at their diverse offerings.

The food is creative and tastes good -- not fall-off-your-chair good, but what you would expect at a modern bistro.  I've had the lobster BLT, the turkey club and the brunch Benedict and I would order them all again. The 'Cortado' spanish-style coffee (brought over from the coffee bar) is outrageously good. Our servers were very nice and tried to get back to our table occasionally though the place was very busy.  We had the small tea service on Saturday and it was pleasant, although the selection of cakes and scones was quite underwhelming (we got 6 of the same kind, and no jam or cream or anything like that).  They were preparing for a wedding, so it seemed like the tea hours were an afterthought that day.  I would try it again on a less busy afternoon.

I believe that as long as OE can keep the quality very high, listen to their customers and not get lazy, this emporium may very well become a lasting attraction for downtown Tampa.",5.0,2,1

My guest is vegetarian so you know which one of those she ate haha. This place as the best veggie egg rolls I have ever had, no joke. I will be coming back just for those alone. the beef lo mein was also delicious. the noodles were thicker then I was use to, but no complaints here. my guest said the vegetarian fried rice was some of the best she has had also.

Even better, I was told that I had apparently overpaid for my license at some point, so I had a credit that covered the cost of my drivers license. So, no only did I walk out less than 15 minutes after arriving, but it didn't cost me anything. That's what I call a damn good day at the BMV.",4.0,2,0

"My family adopted a dog yesterday and while the adoption process and helpfulness of staff was good I felt that the adoption fee for a dog at a NON PROFIT SHELTER was way beyond belief. $400 from ACCT is too much. This is a shelter that uses volunteers instead of paid staff where they can, and yet the dogs and cats are housed in horrible cramped dark and dank runs. I moved here from AZ where non profit Maricopa County Care and Control had nice bright shelters runs and play areas as well as meet and greet areas with fake grass and umbrellas for the heat and sun. Ditto for the AZ Humane Society. Both non profits and with large volunteer staff. Yet the adoptions fees were reasonable. I think ACCT needs an audit to see where the bucks are going.

This place had homemade beer and root beer. I had the root kind and it was good. Tasted like A&W but good. I had the avocado wrap app with the dipping sauce and the sauce made this dish! We also tried the calamari which was delicious and not overly greasy. The cream dipping sauce was very tasty. I had a custom sandwich- I did blackened mahi on bread like the Cali chicken club minus the bacon. They charged an additional $4.95 for the change. I also added BBQ sauce.

"Unfortunately this particular location does not stack up to the other locations I've been to. We showed up on a Thursday night at 5:30 and totally expected to wait but we were told the wait would be 10 minutes. 30 minutes later we got seated and we waited another 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. We were then informed when the waiter brought our drinks that they were out of ice so we were stuck with luke warm tap water. He seemed unapologetic. I ordered chili and my husband ordered a burger, we waited about another 30 minutes for our food. When the food arrived, they forgot his side of bbq sauce he requested and since our waiter disappeared, we had to ask another server for the bbq sauce. Nobody returned to our table and we had to waive down our waiter for the check. It was not until that moment that he offered to refill our empty water glasses. We saw that he was serving 4 other (small party) tables but then would disappear into the back. Normally I'd chalk it up to a bad waiter but the entire staff appeared to be unorganized and uninterested in being there.

Today there was no attitude with my order either, the guy was polite. I was informed by this employee that this location is the only one that delivers and they are open until midnight on Friday and Saturday (Great news for night owls.)

"VIVA Modern Mexican is a hidden gem! Located in one of the most beautiful buildings in Santa Barbara with the most delicious food.

The food continues to look more and more delicious and the service is becoming better and better as this business continues to improve.

"This place changed my mind about macaroons! I can't believe I've been missing out on these. I wish we had Sucre in Los Angeles!

Perfect for gifts, definitely on the pricey side. Adorable sweets packed into cute printed boxes and tied with perfect ribbons - the perfect present to bring home for your sweetie for Valentine's Day.

The macaroons are to die for. The king cake was the best tasting and Mardi Gras themed with yummy gold, purple, and green coloring, super cute! The least favorite was the white chocolate raspberry. It had that fake-berry flavoring that can taste similar to cough syrup sometimes. Regardless, it was still much better than any other macaroon I've tasted back home.

Very expensive little cookies! The assorted 15 piece box bought was $29! These delightful macaroons are truly worth it! I immediately regretted buying the one small box of macaroons! Amazing!

The gelato on the other-hand is not stand-out in my opinion. The flavors all look incredible, but taste-wise, I thought the ones tried were lacking. Skip it and go straight for the macaroons, you will not be disappointed... and get an extra box for later - I guarantee you will want more!",4.0,2,2

"I have been seeing Dr. Brent Davidson for over a decade now at Envision Eye Specialists. He's one of the only Ophthalmic doctors I trust with my eyes, and since my eyes are my entire career, that's a pretty big deal. 

When I first saw Dr. Davidson in my early 20s, I had been to several ophthalmic doctors who insisted my high eye pressures were due to glaucoma. Dr. Davidson was able to determine this was not true and that I actually had Pigment Dispersion Syndrome (PDS). He has great bedside manner, and is always happy to explain what is going on with your eyes in layman's terms. 

I'm a near-sighted Type One Diabetic also, so Dr. Davidson has done a wonderful job over the years watching for any signs of retinopathy. 

This month, I finally had to undergo SLT surgery to lower the pressures in my eyes from all the pigment build up over the years from the PDS. Dr. Davidson's staff was able to schedule me within a month, and the financial office was able to go over my options based on my not-so-great insurance. They were helpful, spending an hour trying to see what we could do to lower costs, but ultimately the whole procedure will be paid out of pocket due to my insurance (not the doctor's fault though). 

The surgeries have gone well so far, but I have had more side effects than others limiting my vision and light exposure. We'll know for certain if they worked in 6 weeks. 

If you're looking for a trustworthy ophthalmic doctor, I can't recommend Dr. Davidson enough.

"You go somewhere else, now!

This was the owner's comment to me after I returned an order of chicken wings. Why did I return a ""To Go"" order of chicken wings?  Having had their wings to go once before, I knew that they used styrofoam containers. A poor choice of container material for chicken wings straight out of the frier. As you may already be guessing, the chicken wings melted through the styrofoam.  Mmmm what is this delicious foamy coating on my wings?  Having learned a lesson with my first order, I specifically asked them to not use a styrofoam container with my wings order or to completely wrap the wings in wax paper or foil.  After getting my next order home and being assured that the wings were completely wrapped in wax paper, I was disappointed to see that no they had not wrapped the wings in paper and yes the wings did melt the styrofoam container again.  

So, I returned the order of wings within 10 minutes of paying for them.  During my returning of the wings the owner came to the register and asked why I was returning the wings.  I explained that they melted through the styrofoam which is not a healthy situation.  I also suggested that they not serve hot food items in styrofoam unless they advertise that the food comes with a styrofoam coating.  Apparently, the customer is not always right in certain places.  He said ""You go some-a-where else-a now"".  And I say, ""Gladly-a sir!""",1.0,0,0
"Our second time trying Chuys. Our first time was in KY and now in TN. Our 1st time didn't leave a very good impression, so we decided to give them another chance but in a different state. Well. this second time was better but not excellent. time of arrival was after 1pm. Still pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long- to be seated. I was fascinated when I saw a woman making tortillas on the spot.- that was very cool! So we know now , that is one item that will be fresh...I don't know if this is a feature on all the Chuy's restaurants.- but it was on this one! Our server was very friendly and brought our chips and salsa along the jalapenos ranch sauce fairly quickly.  We did liked the jalapenos ranch sauce and salsa. thumbs up on these items.  Now to the main plates. We ordered fish tacos and the chicken enchiladas and the tortilla soup. The fish tacos came with a very good size fish on each taco. The chicken enchiladas had a good presentation but the chicken was very dry chicken and needed a bit of some freshness of something, so I did pour some of the salsa and made it perfect. The rice and beans had good taste. I had the Charros bean with my enchiladas and the fish tacos came with the refried beans. We like the idea you could order two different kinds of beans and rice. The tortilla soup was ""ok to borderline good"" .  Food came in fairly fast. 

One small observation: I would suggest to add to the grand menu some "" GRILL "" items (veggies, meat or chicken or both) for those who are in keto diet. (like us) Even though this was our cheat day-- we did managed some good items (soup and salsa).  Our overall experience was 7.5/10 . This is NOT a keto friendly restaurant.-Just sayin'",3.0,1,1

"The good: The hotel building is nice, clean. Staff were all pleasant and professional. Our room was clean and furnishings were in good condition. 

The not-so-good: The room deodorizer spray was overpowering. Opening the door was much like walking past a Macy's perfume counter the week before Christmas. 

They are very proud of their 22 inch pillow-top mattresses. Unfortunately they put them on top of a very thick box spring. Even at 6' tall I had to climb up onto the bed. 

The mattress was also VERY hard. Putting a three inch slate pillow on a 19 inch brick slab doesn't make it soft. 

They also never bothered to buy mattress pads and bottom sheets to fit the mattress. The pad was made for an eight inch mattress so the corners kept popping off, and the bottom sheet was a standard king-size flat sheet so it wasn't long or wide enough to tuck in, but rather was draped over the mattress. 

Breakfast food quality was very good, and the wait staff was doing their best to keep a smile on their faces and be pleasant. But they were woefully understaffed and glasses, cups, plates, and food were continually in short supply. We ended up using cereal bowls for our eggs, sausage, potatoes, etc. because there never were any plates available.

"If the name of my restaurant was my last name I'd make dam sure it was good!  Well Charles LaScala shouldn't worry because this is a very good mid-level Italian restaurant.

I've been to dinner, lunch, and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good.

First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs.  This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal.  So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar.  I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating.

Second, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place.  It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10.  So consider yourself forewarned.

So let's talk about all the positive attributes-

The location is fabulous.  It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc.  

The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching.

These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia.  That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building.  If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM.  

They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient.  By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings.

Regarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions.  It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion.  Everybody will be happy here.  Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entrées to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. 

The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for.  It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta.  The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent.  It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce.

"Bam! Of course I had to hit up one of Emeril's restaurants while in town! When we got here for lunch, the place was pretty quiet but soon it filled up. Since it was our last day, we were still stuffed from all our previous meals. 

So, mom ordered Mrs. Hay's Vietnamese Fried Oyster Po'Boy, which was amazing and out of this world delicious. It came with some kimchi, which was really on point. The oysters were delicious!!! 

For me, I got the chicken and waffles. It was huge. The mac & cheese side dish it came with was super spicy, way more than I'd expect or was used to (and trust me, I love my spice!). I couldn't even finish it. The chicken and waffles themselves were alright, not as good as I was hoping. I think mom made the better choice!

We split the banana layered bread dessert and it was out of this world delicious. It was the perfect end to the meal. Sweet but not overly sweet. And also, light as a feather. So good that I almost want to write it a love letter. 

I also ordered the Sazerac drink, which was pretty good. Not as strong as one would think. 

The wait staff are friendly and very on point. They tried to keep up with water intake, which is always appreciated. I also love the decor of the restaurant. 

I would definitely return - but next time, I'm going to be the one ordering the fried oyster po boy!",4.0,2,2
I certainly enjoy this place. You may be a couple bucks more expensive then other places around this area but I think they make up for it with quality. Very friendly staff and great food. I come here at least once a month because I just need my fix. The feed is fresh and enjoyable. I can't recommend China Wok enough.,5.0,2,2
I'm amazed by the pizza. The Americano is the best pizza I've had in philly. I met the owners and they explained to me that their flower comes directly from Italy and is milled a certain way so it's really fine and that's what creates a crispy tasty pizza and crust. The sauce is very good and so was the cheese. I highly recommend this place and I'm glad I found them. I ordered two pizzas and one week they were so good!,5.0,2,2

"This new Milpas SB Trader Joe's is one of the biggest trader Joe's  units I have ever been in. And I have been in a lot: from Portland to Nyc.
All of the sections / food categories are jam packed with old favorites as well as new stuff.
Cauliflower pizza crusts ready to top with sauce and such : totally gluten free for those interested.  And for those not interested an at least interesting way to make a home pizza eschewing all the carbs associated with that old devil wheat.
I honestly didn't get a chance nor was I interested in touring the entire store hut give me time.
On the people watching front . There were several of the regulars in attendance. People you will find at any TJ'S anywhere! I saw the slim women with a basket full of fresh produce who probably has not eaten a burger since 1967.
 There was the dude who asked 1000 questions of a clerk about non gluten items and then bought 4 big fat wheat based baquettes. 
There was an ""alternative ""  man : I guess some would call a hipster wearing his hipster drag , salt and pepper beard down to his groin, trolling the beer section looking for the most obscure variety available looking bored, so bored. 
We were all treated with respect and interest by the tj's peeps.
I love Trader Joe's
 I really do.

My mission today was to buy Wine, Vino, Vinito! And buy wine and champs I did indeed.
There are wines here that I have not seen in any other TJ'S that I usually shop.

"First of all let me say Stefani gave me the BEST hair cut of my life at this salon. She listened to me, and offered suggestion that improved on my own ideas. The price is more then reasonable for the quality and the staff was friendly and well informed. I got a shorter haircut then I've had in 8 years and I was scared out of my mind but it looks great!
However, the reason I did not give them five stars is for a few small things. I was kept waiting about 10 minutes for my appointment. Not a deal breaker but it did happen. While I was getting my hair shampooed I inquired about the product and I was told that I shouldn't really be using using it. I later overheard the women saying they were low on product and that was why it had been used on my hair. Both of these things are nitpicky and minor. 
Overall this is a great salon. It is really more of a 4.5 star salon then a 4 star one. I personally plan on going back and I recommend it to anyone looking for a new (and wonderful) stylist!",4.0,2,2
"Okay, maybe it was the beer. No, it was not the beer. Four beers give me a buzz, but not pizza goggles.

The night started out at a bar with a Brooklyn theme, and by chance I ended up at a pizza joint that reminded me of Brooklyn pizza.

I'm from Brooklyn, so this is no loose use of Brooklyn pizza. And no, I am not suggesting this compares to the best of NYC. I'm saying this is just as good as a decent pizza joint in NYC, and that is saying a lot for Philly pizza.

No offense, but Philly is known for their pretzels and cheese steaks, not pizza. But I will be dammed, I stumbled upon a real gem. Hands down, best pizza I have had in the eight months I have lived in Philly.",5.0,2,0

That said I ordered a chicken salad sandwich.....simple enough right, WRONG! After being closed for 5 days and reopening today you would think they would have all items on the menu ready to be ordered well I guess not. I guess only certain items on the menu are available on there reopening day. So I ordered the Nashville Hot chicken sandwich which was mediocre at best. And to top it off the service was horrible and slow. The server  seemed to have forgotten about the table I guess.I guess I should have opted for the buffet instead.

Then, after they changed my oil they came out to tell me my car was leaking anti-freeze and wanted to ""make sure I didn't think they poked a hole or anything.""

"Cochon Butcher  is the brainchild of celebrity Chef Donald Link and is attached to his Cochon restaurant.  The Butcher offers a gourmet butchery that has unique cuts of meats and sausages and a small amount of other gourmet edibles. I would say that the actual butcher is overshadowed by the casual dining experience that it provides. The menu is filled with a number of delicious sandwiches, sides and small plates. It's a little on the expensive side but the food is fresh, creative and delicious. It has a large daily lunch crowd as well as being a favorite for a quick dinner. Order at the counter and eat on high bar tables and stools around the newly expanded spot. It's a great place for a sandwich some sides and maybe a nice glass of red. Well I like a nice glass of red with just about all savory foods.",5.0,2,2

"I went to Root on a Sunday night and was very pleased with the experience. The food is inventive and delicious and the ambiance and service were top notch! I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are into modern, interesting food. To break it down:

Food - we had a charcueterie (sp?) and sausage plate. I really enjoyed this and thought you got a lot of sausage for the money. It was quite filling with just one sausage and one charcuterie. We also got the KFC fried chicken wings, which were amazing. For the main, we split the ribeye and fries, which I loved. For dessert we had the bread pudding - it was only okay. They also give you a free amouse bouche and a mid meal palate cleanser - very nice!

Ambiance - Modern and sophisticated, but inviting. The only thing I didn't like were the chairs - kind of uncomfortable, especially if you are wearing a shorter skirt.

Service - excellent!!! Very attentive and knowledgable. 

All in all I really enjoyed Root and would definitely return to try some of their other dishes!",4.0,2,2
"My husband and I stopped in here for drinks and apps before a movie. The restaurant was slammed but we easily found a spot at the bar. We had a delish spinach and artichoke dip and an ok flat bread pizza--a tad greasy. The drinks were mediocre. I first ordered some vodka mixture that was a ""signature drink."" It was god awful! Way to fruity and sugary. Tasted like a frat house punch. I guess that could be a good thing depending on your goals for the night. Next drink was a V&T, hard to mess that one up. 
I'd go again, it was a nice bar atmosphere and we could easily hear each other. I hear the main restaurant is great.",3.0,1,0

You find a place to sit and hope no one takes it when you pick up your beer at the counter, mind you that the beer they serve is available at a dozen places in south Reno. Then when your food is ready they call you over the pa system and you walk to the far corner to pick it up. The parking SUCKS! The ONLY this place has going for it is the excellent food. I used to frequent the Shop N Go that was there because they were knowledgeable about the beer they served and Kevin, Hector and Daven acted like they were glad you were there. It's funny what people will tolerate when they pay good money for a dining experience. Something else other than the food has got to shine before I go back.

However, I emailed a credit card release to the email indicated on their website twice with no reply. I decided to overlook this.

"What a surprise--a pleasant one! Gary, my husband, and I have lived in Tucson and passed that place for years. We never paid attention. I don't know why, really. It looks kind of unassuming from the front view. I had an Entertainment book deal for the restaurant, so we ventured to try it. It's fun to support the local restaurants, too!

What a wonderful restaurant! It is a whole lot larger than it seems from the outside. Fun atmosphere, mariachis singing 'round the diners, very family oriented and there is a very separate bar area (didn't peek at it). Colorful decorations make for a cheery ambiance. It was Wednesday around 6 pm on a summer day (the slowest time in Tucson), and yet the place was packed. All other restaurants are struggling to draw in diners with the sluggish economy. This restauarnt obviously had regulars and a loyal following.

We were seated quickly and given a fun menu. Waitstaff were friendly. The food is not your traditional Mexican, but instead very different types of sauces and mixtures of Mexican foods Maybe Guadalajaran food is like this, or maybe this restaurant is especially creative? Not sure. 

We were greeted by a salsa lady pulling around a cheerful cart on wheels. I loved this feature. It was packed with bowls of various veggies and makin's for salsa. She asked if we liked mild, medium or hot. Since Gary likes hot and I like mild, she actually made us TWO salsas! They came in these huge bowls, too-great presentation--and great flavors! My mild (I know, I'm the gringa about HOT food) salsa had large and mild green chile pieces in it along with onions, and all the usual yummy salsa ingredients. I dove in with the nice, thick, fresh chips (very light on salt) for an excellent salsa-chip experience. 

The main meal was hard to choose as the menu has more creative choices than just the usual burrito/taco, etc. line-up. I got a carne asada, chile relleno and chicken enchilada combo. Gary ordered the Ultimate something (didn't see the name). Both dishes arrived, mine on a huge plate and his in a stone huge container that weighed probably 10 lbs. Very unique. It contained what I like to say seemed like a Mexican cioppino. Grilled shrimp, chicken, beef and more was in it, in a tomato-based sauce (very flavorful), topped with some feta-looking Mexican-type cheese (sorry 'bout my silly word phrases-didn't get the real names of things too well). We dove in; the food was terrific! The diners around us also looked very contented.

All I know is that I look forward to returning to this place to experiment with other delights on their menu! And I better get back to work or my Office Manager will catch me writing this during work (I'm the boss but she keeps me on track! This was my little mental break moment, to share with you while it was fresh in my mind) Hope it helps you!",4.0,2,2

First, the bar tender is a great, friendly guy. No shade on him at all. Save the shade for the Caesar salad.

Small Caesar Salad - seriously - they poured dressing over some lettuce. My salad was not tossed! I can't get over this. I was so ""shook"" by this lazy salad I barely tasted my third beer.

This may be worse than the time I was asked if I wanted Caesar dressing on my Caesar salad. (Hello Rocknes in Akron, OH).

"I may not be from here originally and I may not have known what the hell chicory coffee was until I moved here, but I'm not ashamed to say that I am fully and utterly addicted to cafe au lait and all of that is due to this lovely mecca of cafe.

Each and every person that comes to visit me is drug to the wonderful establishment in the middle of the french quarter even if they don't drink coffee!

I have officially crossed over at least ten individuals and they are now in love and forever in love with cafe au lait!!!

Can't beat it so might as well join it!!!",5.0,2,1
"First impression was eloquent and creative.  
When I sat down I was greeted by very friendly staff who upon siting me introduced me to the drink specials and new food specials, I took a couple minutes after ordering a rum and coke cocktail (because the have a FULL BAR!) and was referred to the Chicken relleno which was very good, I've actually never had a relleno until I went to Rudy's.  I was very impressed.  The stuffed it with this delicious white cheese and a season grilled chicken.  Plus there was a fresh house made chipotle sauce that I thought made the dish.  Keep it up Rudy's and I will see you next week.

I would recommend this to my friends.
I also love there fresh authentic margaritas, with fresh squeezed limes every day.  They don't even use a pre-made mix, that is how serious they are about their specialty drinks.",5.0,2,2

Small restaurant with great food! For 4 adults + 2 kids. We ordered 4 dishes and 1 kids meal. They all came out great and we had too much food. The fried red snapper was very fresh and tasty. The food portion was big. So I would recommend watch out how much you order or order some dishes which will be ok for taking home. We only finished half of the seafood fried rice and had the left over for lunch. It came with a lot of seafood in the rice and just done right.,4.0,2,2
"Horrible experience. Everything started fine and seemed normal. Get X-rays. Get my gum line examined and teeth checked for cavities. 
This is when things took a turn. Dr. returns to let me know I have bacteria build up and a minor infection in some locations and I would need a ""deep"" cleaning. I explained I only wanted a basic cleaning and the Dr. said they could not do that for me. Then proceeds to hand me a sheet of paper with the cost of materials and services totaling over $1000 (over $350 out of pocket after insurance). After reviewing the billing statement, half of the items were ""extra"" things that were not ""required"" such as a tooth brush and special creams etc...after 15 minutes or so of ""negotiating"" they agreed I didn't need half of the items and I would pay $150 out of pocket just for a cleaning.

Finally, I think I am going to get a cleaning, only to find out the Dr. is going to lunch and it can't be done for another 2 hours!!! I ended up getting nothing done for 2 hours and looking for another dentist.

"I want to first start off by saying thank you to management for fitting my ladies of 14 in a great location together at this establishment. 

We had an amazing time, great fellowship, and even better food and drinks. I had the steak fajitas which was amazing. Steak was cooked to perfection, margaritas was chilled and done perfectly. Probably one of the best margaritas I've had since being in Nashville!! Some people tried the lemon drop which I heard was breathe taking also. The question was creamy and fulfilling! I would say this place should be 5 stars. The service was outstanding for a big group, our waiter did awesome. Thanks again and we definitely will be back soon!!


Parking was the only issue. Nashville parking is crazy but down the road about a block parking is 10$ so be prepared for that. But that's cheap compared to downtown!!",5.0,2,2
I'm so HAPPY!  When the owners of this restaurant sold their former restaurant I've been searching high and low for a Singapore Mei Fun that was comparable to the one that they serve here. It is truly BETTER than the one that is available in the Asian restaurant in the Bellagio in Las Vegas.  Just had the Singapore Mei Fun and it is as good as if not better than that remember.  That is not the only thing they serve. I'm sure all the dishes that they served me at the old place are just as good here. I'll be back!,5.0,2,2
"This place is so... Posh. So hip. So... Trendy. I imagine I'd feel at home here if I was a 20-something naive girl who just moved to Nola to pursue a career in library science or baking. And maybe I'd wear oversized glasses and a plaid scarf with skinny blue jeans and a messy bun. But alas I am none of those things. However, I can appreciate this place for what it is.

Initial impressions :
-small menu. Love small menus.
-plaid shirt and blue jeans uniform. Love uniforms.
-open spaces with huge windows for prime Instagram posts.
-technology on iPad for seating and organizing the crew.

The good :
- food is delicious. Well prepared eggs and
 very appealing dishes.
-coffee on point.
-corn bread hot and butter not pre-packaged. I hate pre-packaged butter.
-nice staff. Seem to be very efficient and not too nice. I don't trust people that are too nice or people that say ""trust me"". No thanks, I won't.

The bad:
-they ran out of juices at 10:30 am? The fuck??
-prices kind of steep. 

Overall a good place if you're into posh, trendy, or fetch things.",4.0,2,2

"My girls and I left Chumash Casino and I found this gem in Santa Barbara. This breakfast spot has really great reviews on yelp so we decided to have breakfast by the water. The food was absolutely delicious very tasty and everything was fresh. It was 5 of us and the young man said  20 minutes, that was cool. They only have 2 sets of tables that sit 6. One set was in the shade and the other in the sun.  I asked the young man why would you seat 2 ppl at the table for 6 instead of the 4 seated table. He says we have another table that will seat you and I said yes but it's in the sun and the tables were not in the same decor. Oh well everything else was excellent, I would go back and I still recommend this gem to anyone.",4.0,2,2
"I purchased a Groupon not knowing what to expect but the first thing I noticed was the place was very beautiful and clean. I felt like I was in a salon in NYC.

Chris was very nice and easy to talk to, plus he's an Eagles fan (so that's a plus! ). He was very knowledgeable about the colors that where previously put in my hair and matched my roots perfectly!! Not a two tone color in sight. I had used a Groupon but their regular prices are reasonably priced as well therefore tempting me to go back again.

"Best meal we had while in NOLA... hands down. 

This is where the locals go to eat and it didn't disappoint. Out of 6 people in our party, we ordered practically everything and shared everything, no ones meal sucked!

We came here at the recommendation of our bartender at O'briens, his brother works there. Not going to go into detail of each item, however the best item overall were the char broiled oysters (regular not Óscar style). These were better than any char broiled oysters I've had anywhere! Period! They were simply scrumptious, if you're splurging, pig out and order plenty!

We had an excellent bartender and server. 

I'd go here at least once a day to eat lunch or dinner not kidding. It's that good!

We added vinegar to the salad dressing as it was all oil.  The Greek potatoes were okay... we added Feta and lemon we had at home. Positive was the salad itself looked great but had no pepprochini.  Plentiful. The Baklava was very good.  Last week, one of my employees ordered the Spanakopita.   It was excellent.  Sadly, still I had to throw my gyro away.  Disappointed.",2.0,0,1
"Over all good steak house and great ambiance. Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive to our drinks etc. didn't go above and beyond but did his job very well. I got the BONE-IN KONA CRUSTED DRY AGED NY STRIP WITH SHALLOT BUTTER and ordered it medium rare Pittsburgh style. They must really like Pittsburgh because it was extremely charred. Like tasted almost like I was eating a BBQ grill itself -- it may have been my fault in ordering, not sure. Nonetheless, it was still good.

My only true complaint about the steak is that I really don't think it's aged properly because it's extremely runny with a pool of blood after I was done.

Dessert was delicious- I had the coconut cream pie which was so so good!!! The whip cream was a lot and mostly unnecessary but the actual pie was so good. Cohesive and so yummy.",4.0,2,2
"This place was delicious. The guy at the Voodoo Historical Museum down the street recommended the Eggs Dauphine, which he said was basically a cajun twist on Eggs Benedict. I've never been a huge Benedict eater, but we decided to go with his suggestion. Totally amazing. The sauce was great, the fried green tomatoes were delicious, and the egg was poached perfectly.

I had the gumbo, which was also really good, but not quite as exciting and memorable as the Eggs Dauphine. Atmosphere here is clean and modern. We had to wait 30 minutes to get a table, which I understood when I started to eat their food.",4.0,2,2
"Having owned a family sushi restaurant, I can be a real snob when it comes to eating quality fish. After trying their yellowtail scallion roll, I must say the sashimi quality is the finest I've ever tasted and I've had some great sashimi. I'd honestly go back and just order a bunch of sashimi and sushi from there next visit and I know it would be worth every penny.

As for appetizers, we also tried wagyu dumplings which were unique, but nothing special. We tried their Morimoto ramen soup which was delicious, but slightly on the saltier side. I wouldn't recommend drinking all of it, but it's perfect when eating it with the udon-like ramen noodles.

For the main entree, I ate the ishi yaki bap with yellowtail which was absolutely delicious. It was also a cool dining experience because the server cooks the yellowtail in front of you using the heat from the stone pot. For the price, it's worth!

Last but not least, I have to say, I was really impressed by the interior design. The dining felt like it was infused into an art exhibit. Would highly recommend for a special occasion or a date spot!

"Down and dirty burrito place.

The burritos are big, service is quick and friendly and if you're still hungry after eating the whole thing, well,  you probably eat too much.  :P

I've gotten the chorizo (upon recommendation) and chicken burritos and was very happy with both.  It's pretty inexpensive given the size of the burritos.

The outside looks kind of dingy and the inside, while and older fast restaurant, is taken care of a bit better so it gives a better feeling.

The choice of salsas are good, fairly spicy and made freshly.

The burritos are fairly fatty and as a result very satisfying, but don't make you sick like chipoltle (which was great when it was a few spots in Denver and turned to hell under McDonald's ownership).",3.0,1,2
"I've been to IA (Iron Abbey, not Iowa) three times now for different occasions -- once for drinks, another time for apps, and, most recently, for a full dinner on my birthday. I enjoyed it each time. 

The beer selection is unparalleled in that area, and I find the food to be creative and delicious. I disagree with an earlier reviewer who said that the charcuterie plate consists of lunch meat. It does have deli meats on it, but they are imported delicacies (mortadella, prosciutto, etc). Also, it comes with this unbelievably good fig jam. When I was there on my bday, I got the ""Original Sin,"" which was crazy good.

The service is also good and ambiance is pleasant. It has this 19th-century, Euro-pub, stone-wall sort of feel to it -- just the kind of ambiance in which you want to eat heavy food and drink a lot of beer.

So, come hungry and sober, because there is a lot of eating and drinking to be done here!",4.0,2,2

"Went there last Thursday for dinner. After sitting for 10 minutes or so without anyone coming to take a drink order or acknowledge my wife and I were sitting there. 
After Jai our server took our drink and food orders we waited...and waited and waited. Our dinks finally arrived another 10 minutes later. My hot tea was like warm. 
10 minutes after that our vegetable and shrimp spring rolls came. 15 minutes after that our cold dumplings arrived. Jai came by...finally to see how everything was and I told her about the cold dumplings. 'Do you want me to nuke them?' Asked Jai.. no thanks. We will just take them home. My wife had ordered sweet and sour chicken which hadn't come yet. I asked Jai to speak to a manager to which she replied...'ok. Let me see who I can find.' 15 minutes later some other server came to find out what was wrong. Again we explained our displeasure...'let me see what I can do'. In the meantime the 'all dressed in black' food walkers tried to drop off my wife's entree. We sent it back. 
Jai came by and said.. 'ok...I talked to the manager and the owner and they agreed not to charge you for anything you haven't eaten. We left the dumplings... LOLOL ok ..the owner?

"Horrible value, quality and responsiveness!

DO NOT USE THIS MOVING COMPANY.  They will severely overcharge you and not honor the terms of your contract.  They are inexperienced and will damage your furniture.  The customer service is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  

I am severely disappointed with how this company handled my mother's move.  They didn't send the proper crew to move her (even after they came out to evaluate her needs BEFORE she moved).  They took double the time they were supposed to, then inconvenienced her by delivering on Monday when it was supposed to be Saturday.  She injured herself helping them move because the crew was insufficient.  They damaged her furniture - then tried to charge her more money for their mistakes!  

Bekins only response to all this was to not charge her $1160 more ON TOP of the fortune she already paid to move a 2-bedroom a measly eight (8) miles and waive the $250 deductible for her damage claim.

I have a lot of experience with professional movers and this is absolutely unheard of.",1.0,0,0

Jambalaya was some of the best i had. 
Seafood gumbo was little more than broth with tiny shrimp. 
Crawfish etoufee was delicious, but short on crawfish, and a little heavy. 
Giant glasses of water keep the refills down. 
Great frog legs and zydeco meat pies, but appetizers a little heavy on the fried foods. Fried crawfish tails? really?

"Extremely thorough, professional, and reliable! They really set the bar high! I have now used Bent Nail Inspections for two of my homes, thanks to the recommendation of my wonderful realtor. The first time was back in 2018 when I bought my very first home, my pride, soon to become my very cherished rental property. Bent Nails went all out to make sure the sellers weren't hiding anything that was wrong. The home was newer so there wasn't much wrong, made it easy to flip through the pages of the report. 

I was even more impressed when we had them once more inspect another house we bought in 2020. First off, the inspect report was fat! So much information. It was an older home, there was a lot to point out and our inspector made sure to notate every last detail. He went as far as to notate every single crack in the Sheetrock, even chips on the toilet!

"I love Pat's!  Pat's is an Irish restaurant/pub that sells fried up American food.  It was founded by an Irishman over 60 years ago, but at this point, it's more of a Dogtown neighborhood hangout.  Very casual & very laid back.  

They have entertainment occasionally, but usually it's the jukebox upstairs in ""The Roost.""  The Roost is brighter and cheerier than the restaurant downstairs.  It's a hoot and you can usually have a laugh with Pat's Irish Hurling team who hang out after game/practice.

Any time I plan a winery trip or day trip, we usually start out at Pat's.  Joe gives us a deal where everyone on the bus can get a full buffet style breakfast for $5 per person.  Just call ahead to organize.

Pretty hip decor when you walk into this location. My first time visiting this restaurant chain so I was pretty excited to see how it is ahead of time on one being built closer to home in California. I ordered the three chicken finger meal which came with fries and slaw. The chicken and fries were really really good along with their special dipping sauce. But the slaw I was not A fan of. Just seemed very bland to me but I could say that I see myself visiting a raising Cane's location again just based off of this experience and they're willing to work with the associates here. My minus one star rating for this particular location is the restroom. There were no seat covers provided nor was there a spot for seat covers to be post it too on the wall. And when you go to wash your hands the soap machine dispenser is completely broken as there were pieces on the counter. So I feel that the restroom should be a key point as well when it comes to an all-around visit.,4.0,2,2
"Great place for all you can eat at a fair price. The chefs make the food extremely fast and they have a wide choice of sushi, sashimi, rolls, deluxe rolls, as well as hot choices like satay, teriyaki, and tempura.

I'd really rate the place a 4 1/2 if able as the quality isn't the best (some fish tastes a bit flatter than normal and the rice needs a bit more rice vinegar), but overall it is a very good experience.

Not the cheapest AYCE place (""Cho Cho San"" on Sunday has a better deal and similar quality), but if it isn't Sunday then Oki Sushi is one of the best places you can get to get your sushi fix at a fair price.",5.0,2,2

I came here for a gel manicure and regular pedicure. They put gel on my toes even though I specifically asked for a regular pedicure and charged me $99. Although my nails looked pretty the polish was chipping the very next day. I had a design on two of my nails that also fell off the following day. I am new to Edmonton and normally pay $47USD for gel nails with pedicure. I would not recommend this spot. I am still on the hunt for a good nail spa in the West End that can give a deadly mani/pedi and not rape my wallet.,1.0,0,0

"Yelp steered us wrong this time. Food was ok. Although just the smell of our go-to dduk mandoo guk made my son gag (it was very peppery). We came here after a long day at sesame place. Service was awful. Wasn't crowded but we prob saw our waitress 2x- hardly spoke to us. We're korean too so if she couldn't speak English she could have at least tried to speak to us in Korean. We would have appreciated a simple ""would you like more water?"" since all our glasses were empty for most of our meal. But our waitress was not a pleasant person. Her disposition really pissed me off so we didn't bother asking her for anything. So we left spending a decent amount of $ with two hungry kids and five thirsty people and two angry adults.

"It seems like all of St. Louis gets their daily pizza from a chain called Imo's with over 40 locations in the area!!! I cannot remember ever seeing a Papa John's or a Dominos ever, anywhere, which could suggest a Socialist cabal that controls the pizza market here, in cahoots with corrupt City Government. They may even have had a hand in the murder of A. Scalia, who knows? I am of course only speculating.

One thing that supports a conspiracy theory when it comes to St. Louis-style pizza is their choice of cheese. No mozzarella for them, rather a cheese-hybrid called ""Provel"" that has a lower melting temperature, and thus you avoid the stringy gooey mozzarella effect that normal Americans delight in with their pizza. The color is dull orangey-yellow, and Provel would be unpleasant if it were not just flavorless. 

That and the fact that circular pizzas are sliced like the Cartesian gridwork that makes up most of the city, indeed the Midwest.

It's a St. Louis thang, and of course all the natives who grew up with this worse-than-Velveeta caliber Provel wax nostalgic about their native cheese, and outsiders like myself shake their heads.... and vote with their stars.

Certain Imo's chains will allow mozzarella substitutions, so I recommend a half-n-half approach so you can at least say that you tried the ""authentic"" St. Louis pizza.",2.0,0,1
"Excellent food. The mushroom ravioli was perfect. The fillet mignon came with rice and a nice Thai spicy sauce. The souffle was weird.. very eggy and even the Chocolate souffle did not taste like chocolate. It was definitely different and you should at least give it a try.

"I really can't say enough nice things about this little place. Bottom line: I loved every bite and can't wait to go back - great service, killer happy hour, nightly live music, and some of the best food I've had all year. 

Cassie, our waitress was perfect - warm and eager to talk about how much she loves the menu. When we asked her what her faves were, she literally sat down with us to give us the scoop! Clearly it was a serious convo that couldn't be had standing! It was the perfect amount of familiarity without being off-putting (as I've recently experienced a lot elsewhere). 

The important part: FOOD (OMG) - started with the Brussels sprouts, which are apparently having a moment in the NOLA restaurant circuit right now, but these are definitely the best I've had yet. Served perfectly crisped in a buttery glaze with crème fraîche and slices of grapefruit and tangerine - never had anything like it! Loved the combo of flavors and textures - not at all heavy or greasy thanks to the slices of citrus and the creme. 

Then came the root beer glazed pork chop bites - small portion (just two nuggets), but very reasonably priced at $5. I really could have just asked for three orders of these and called it a day - super flavorful and tenderly cooked and - GET THIS  - served atop toasted marshmallow! WHO THINKS OF THIS GENIUS? So like the sprouts, it was a victory for the happy marriage of sweet and savory. 

The last thing we ordered took the cake (which I'm sure is hard to believe, considering how I've raved about the prior two dishes): The fried oyster bruschetta was basically mind-bending. Admittedly it was difficult to fit everything that was generously piled upon the bread in your mouth in a single bite, but once that complete bite was attained (after a little rearranging of the toppings and perhaps a little jaw-unhinging) and all of the dish's components were packed snugly in your mouth, you will have the happy experience of enjoying one of my top five favorite bites of food I've had in the past year: deliciously seasoned, crispy fried oysters (I don't even really like oysters), creamy truffle-edamame puree (I don't even really like edamame), and stupidly good tomato relish (I don't even really like tomatoes) that I would eat by the spoonful in a heartbeat. So, I guess I'm a fan?

Not to mention the great live music and yummy cocktails (on a menu that was comprehensible! pet peeve = drink menus that are mostly ingredients I have to google). I'M COMIN BACK SOON, YALL. 5 Stars.",5.0,2,2

"Floating is an experience I think everyone should try for relaxation.  I picked this location because the tanks are larger than the other location and I wanted my first time to go smoothly.  When I first came in, I was greeted by a friendly woman who throughly explained the process to me.  She didn't rush me and let me ask any questions.  It was really nice because during the process I didn't have to think too much because everything was explained to me so well.  

I was also explained that I could leave the door to the tank open or closed.  I could leave the lights on or off.  I could do whatever made me comfortable.  I turned the lights off and shut the tank door because I wanted the full experience.  The tank was in my own room along with the shower, so it didn't matter if I left the tank door open or closed.  It was  very relaxing.

There is 2 hour parking out front, but since it was my first time, I parked in the all day parking and had to walk a block.  I didn't want to be stressed out during the experience thinking about getting a parking ticket.

"Found our experience here pretty lackluster. 

It was my first time here, and although pretty familiar with Manayunk I never thought to come here. We were a party of seven and were seated right away. The menu selection is decent, but nothing really stuck out to me so I opted for a salad. I ordered the steak salad which was $16. From the presentation to the taste it was all around bad. Maybe worth half of that sixteen dollars. It also came with a chipotle sauce that was so spicy my nose was actually running. Weird feeling while eating a salad. 

We ordered nachos as an app with condiments on the side, and it came out with everything on it... bacon cheeseburgers without bacon as well. Our server even pulled the ""you never said bacon"".

Three of us went here the other day and ordered breaded almond chicken, ginger beef, mixed vegetables and shrimp fried rice.  It came to about $40 (rougly 10 bucks a dish) and the servings were massive, so much so that we all had sufficient food for the next day.  The breaded chicken was incredibly delicious.  I'm not sure what they do with the chicken here, but it's very tasty and succulent.  The ginger beef was tasty too, although it's not technically called ginger beef.  They refer to it as Szechwan beef.   I'm not sure how close to real ginger beef this is, but it was certainly quite delicious.

The service is fast!  We couldn't finish our first round of teas and the food was already out.  Food is delicious and in plenty.  The owner/waiters etc. at this place are so nice and friendly.

I rented from this company for a short time before having my lease taken over by a friend of mine.  I returned home for a month while still having the lease and told management to leave the stuff in my room for the next tenant who was my friend and they said it was fine.

"This review for Capital City Heating & Cooling is long overdue. We met Michael after buying our home in 2017. It was a home that was over 100 years old with one gas wall furnace that was about 20 years old and a few electric baseboard heaters that all needed to be replaced. When Michael left our home after our first meeting that day, I was in complete awe at the offer he just made us. The most generous of your family members would not have even offered you this. We moved forward with the install and had a nicely heated home for the winter. Come spring, we had met Max to go over the scope of work for our renovation to install a few new floor register locations and relocate a few others, as well as some misc. flue mechanical work too. Our Charlatan of a GC who promised to cover and protect all the brand new floor duct register openings failed to do so among many other things. He also found a way to smash, tear or somehow compromise the integrity of brand new ducts under the home that now needed to be replaced though they had just seen one winter of use. Around the time that Capital City installed our A/C, they also came back to replace all the duct work they installed less than a year earlier and to also replace a radon venting pipe in the wall that the Charlatan GC shot a nail through when installing baseboard, which caused a leak. Michael & Jenny know how to run a business! Max is also excellent at his job and was always helpful anytime I reached out to him with anything. Brandon is a very rare breed with workers today. Poor Brandon,... I told him that his biggest mistake was doing such a great job the first time he worked in our house that I continued to request him each time afterward:)",5.0,2,2

"I stayed here in September of 2009. 

I've stayed in all the Starwood properties in New Orleans now and I would say this is probably the nicest. 

Located on Canal Street, it is on the edge of the French Quarter. Fortunately, New Orleans is a really walkable city... so if visiting, just take a cab, don't bother with a car... and the expensive parking that all hotels in the area have. 

You enter the hotel and take a elevator a few floors up to a very impressive lobby. It was really beautiful. 

Check in was a snap, and all the staff I ran into for our entire 4 days was really great... professional and friendly. 

As a Starwood Platinum, I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a nice suite. The living room was huge and had a phenomenal view of the French Quarter. It had a sofa, and a full dining room table that could seat 8. The bedroom was just as nice and rather large. Seriously, I had 800 or so square feet in total. 

If you are visiting New Orleans... And are addicted to Starwood Points, I would say this is the best property in terms of location and ""most modern"".... But a modern hotel isn't exactly what people go to New Orleans for..... And, this place regularly is more expensive than the Sheraton just down the street.

"My second time to the Brewhouse and both times I came away a bit underwhelmed. The location, outdoor seating, extensive beer list, and wide selection of food options set the Brewhouse up for success. Although my experiences have been ok I must have higher expectations because I've always been hoping for more.

So many of the food items on the menu seems appetizing. The first time I was here I had a decent burger. The patty was bland on the dryer side and the fries were ok. The second time around I had the steak sandwich. Although the sandwich was considerably better than the burger the flavors of the steak even with the au jus were lacking. Again the fries were ok but it seemed like they weren't fresh and they were cooked an hour ahead of time.

The one thing that really stuck out this time around was with one of my beer orders. I asked to ""taste"" one of the beers before I committed to a pitcher. I was surprised to be served a large 4oz glass and was even more surprised to be charged for it. It was disappointing because the waitress didn't tell me ahead of time. It also would have been nice to receive some insight on the different beer selections to help narrow my choices. 

Overall the Brewhouse has serious potential. Unfortunately with all of the new options in the Funk Zone I doubt I'd come back.

"So the review of this place might be a little skewed because we were here during the snow storm in January of 2016.  However that is both probably a pro and a con since they were one of the few places open in the middle of the snowstorm. The pro being that they were open, the con was that they were mobbed.  

The food was delicious, the bartenders we're speeding and professional. The only downside I saw was I was not a huge fan of the picnic style seating in much of the restaurant.

I was wondering why I was offered a pilsner when I asked for an IPA...no porter and no stout either.  The pilsner was fine for a pilsner and the winter bock was pretty good.  Fun atmosphere with large windows behind the bar overlooking the courtyard.",3.0,1,1
"At dinner there last night with family.......yes, Christmas dinner at Shula's.  Let rate it several ways:

Atmosphere- none!  Also extremely loud in the restaurant. 

Service- horrible!  Had apps reasonably quick then waited 2 hours for our dinner to be served. 

Food- average at best. Cold plates, cold food and very bland food. Was there 2 years ago for Christmas.  Food has gone south!

Price- for all the bad service and food you get to pay a fortune. Dinner for four adults, nice bottle of wine, cocktails, apps and shared desert - $685 and a promise from the waiter to ""please come back and we will do better next time"".

No thank you!!",1.0,0,0

"Oh dear, I had hoped for more.

Ironically this was my first revisit to supposedly French cuisine since the 80s in LA. That was a long time ago but memorable.

Sorry folks. This is not French cuisine. Good. Not bad. But I had hoped for more.

I started with the mussels and frites. Mussels- meh. Kind of dry, edible but I had hoped for more. But if you like fries, these were damn good. 

Part deux was the onion soup. Hmm. Good, but such little cheese it lacked the luscious integral part of really great French onion soup.

OK, lets go ""duck"" wild and get the seared duck breast. Beautiful. Done perfectly. I'll repeat- beautiful. The mushroom risotto was also delish but the sautéed haricot vert was done, uh, Hoosier style I guess. Cooked down to death, limp and very unappealing.

Lastly, who can go wrong with a piece of pie imported from the neighboring Sugar Pie establishment in town. Ala mode with an espresso was a nice finish but oh dear, I had hoped for more.

For a 7:15 rez on a Saturday evening I guess the word is out. The place was sparsely occupied. I don't know.. it seems the architecture, heartbeat and personality of the Brick Street Inn doesn't call for French food and I might be on the something.

I had hoped for more. Did I say that already?",2.0,0,1

"Very hip little taco/mezcal spot on Capdeville, in the space formerly occupied by a bar/restaurant by the same name. A couple tables outside, but you definitely need to step inside to appreciate the ambiance.  

I've had EM bookmarked for a year or two and finally made it in for lunch today.  We were seated immediately at a table in the bar area (after vax verification, of course).  The server did a great job.  Started with a mezcal margarita and chips with two salsas. The drink was outstanding.  The chips and salsa, were just okay IMO.  Admittedly, I'm more of a fan of salsas with some texture... not necessarily chunky, but not the total liquid variety like their mild.  The medium was a little better, but nothing to leave you wanting more.  

For entrees, I had a fish taco, a shrimp taco and elote.  All three were very good, but that elote was amazing!  My bride had the chicken adobo torta, which is served with fries.  This is a very large sandwich, loaded with flavor.  (They could get away with calling it a poboy, if only they used Leidenheimer bread). The fries were awesome.

"Pre pandemic I went here frequently - sat at the bar and often had a great time with good food, nice setting and friendly staff.
Last night, sitting outside the staff was still great. However, our burgers were skimpy, weirdly shaped, over seasoned- looked like an overdone air hockey puck inside of a huge roll. When we alerted the waitstaff that one burger was lacking the mushrooms and cheddar ordered she nicely went back to tell the chef. She came back embarrassed as the chef was asking for '""proof"" and wanted to see the burger. 
She did so and returned saying the chef insisted all of the ingredients were there. She was great, agreed with our complaint and took charges for these items off of the bill.
But really, what was up with this chef??? I think an overhaul of the burgers and back of the house attitude need an adjustment here.",2.0,0,1

"Keep your pint glass on Wednesday nights is pure genius, especially with all the different designs that Bulldog puts on their pint glasses. You are definitely tempted to drink more and see which design the bartender bestows upon you next. The selection of drafts to choose from is pretty impressive, so it further encourages you to drink more beer and get more glasses. It's a pretty good deal too since my Abita Amber was $4 and the pint glass alone is $4 on any other night. The next great idea after this is starting a support group for people who are obsessed with collecting Bulldog pint glasses.

My friends and I had a great time at The Bulldog. We met some fun people, and really enjoyed playing Buzzline Trivia. My friends even scored high enough one round to place nationally... their moms would've been so proud. It's a busy crowd on Wednesday night, but coming from NYC that's expected at any worthwhile bar.

The soups range anywhere from lobster bisque to coconut Thai chicken to a bolognese style. All are rich and satisfying. I have yet to find a panini that I like as well as the Tea Place.

"I think when meeting hungry friends after 10 pm in this part of town on a weekend, choices are limited. Pastiche can be relied on to sooth the soul with a jazzy, swanky vibe. The service, though, has taken minimalist aloofness to a new level. If the party isn't having wine, remove the napkin-stuffed balloon glasses pronto. Making eye contact through a sea of superfluous stemware is irksome. Please approach, even if we are talking. We'll stop long enough to order drinks, I promise. I hate to have to flag down a server who has walked by four times and hesitated to ask for our order because we were talking. No need to be phone kiosk aggressive, but please greet us at the very least.
This time we tried he fried avocado, a sparse, albeit interesting appetizer. Thick slices of creamy avocado are lightly breaded and flash-fried until they melt in your mouth. The sauces, a piquant little remoulade and a sweet tomato vinaigrette, are reasonable compliments. The steak salad covered in shoestring fries is an odd amalgam that combines crunchy and chewy, although mixing ketchup and greens was disturbing.

"2/23/19. Very nice experience at Trattoria Giuseppe. If you didn't know it was there you may not even know it exists.  This place is well hidden near a shopping center off of West Chester Pike in Newtown Square. Apparently many people do know it exists as they were handling some large parties and the dining room steadily filled up after we arrived at noon (their opening time on Saturdays) 

It's a huge place and they also have added a banquet/extended area. I managed to walk into the wrong area (of course) but was assisted by polite staff who helped me find my party. 


I was there at lunch to celebrate a birthday for a friend and she chose this restaurant. If you love pasta, this is your place! They had things I've never even heard of. Warm bread is served at the table. It isn't served with the oil and seasonings though, but butter and I'm ok with that.  I opted for the shrimp scampi and it was fantastic. The shrimp were medium sized and plentiful. The sauce was savory garlic and I loved what I think was fresh basil throughout the scampi. I was pleased to also find a smattering of freshly roasted chunks of garlic. We enjoyed the meals very much and they offer lunch or dinner portions. Lunch portions are quite generous. The birthday girl ordered the fruits of the sea and the portion was extremely generous.

They had a list of desserts that seemed to be store made yet very exotic and different. It wasn't easy to choose but we all opted for the cafe coppa which is apparently a soft cheese based almost mousse like dessert. It was outstanding.  

Luis took good care of us and was able to answer our questions. The only thing I had hoped for was automatic iced tea and water refills. We had to ask each & every time as our glasses sat empty. Unfortunately they serve the drinks in very small glasses. We always got what we needed. All staff we encountered was pleasant.",4.0,2,2

Interesting Chris cannot follow up with me after something of this gravity but can quickly do so when it comes on Yelp. That is why I decided to post on Yelp.

Treated like dirt (discriminated against) by unprofessional staff in the locker room. I did report this to the manager after my workout.

Blink just opened in S Philly and is cheaper, better equipment, not cliquey, and certainly none of this BS. 

Full story: Pool open for lap swimming. As I'm exiting the locker room to the pool, a male & female staff (along w/ a female classmate) tell me to literally halt. I thought something was happening in the shower area, maybe allowing a girl to rinse off in the men's locker rm or something, so I did. Waited & learned they were getting free renov ideas from this student. Staff continued to stare at me as if I was some perp w a gun.

"When the line is out the door and everyone in that line is there to order a cheesesteak and NOT pork, you know you are about to get the BEST Cheesesteak in Philly!

We had a friend that claimed this was the best in Philly. We are picky when it comes to cheesesteaks so we had to give this a try!

Verdict? He was right. This is the best cheesesteak WITH AMERICAN CHEESE that we have had and now our favorite cheesesteak - ever. Now, to note, we are fans of cheese whiz on our cheessteaks and always hated American cheese. Why? Because no one melted the cheese within the meat properly. John's Roast Pork knows what they are doing with the cheese. The onions were perfectly caramelized and added so much flavor to the sandwich.

I think my review is going to be hodge podged and disorganized, and I don't think I will come back and make many edits, simply because it matches our experience. The menu was cute (I added a photo that day I think)

People with celiac disease miss out on all kinds of fried foods, so it was nice to find some place where my mom (the one with celiac) could have fish and chips. She said the batter was tasty, and she did enjoy having some fried food. Except the fries. She thought the fries were 'refried' because they were very greasy.  I kind of liked them, but I do see her point. They looked just like the photo in the profile photos.

Fried Food. Those are your keywords to focus on, ok?  The place smelled of over heated fry grease, or grease vents that were in bad need of being cleaned. 

We went in the day after Christmas and the place was freezing. The owner explained that the heat went out over the holiday and having it fixed would be outrageously expensive so they were waiting to get it fixed. There was a small space heater set up by one of the tables, but honestly, with the bitter cold we had that day, it didn't make much difference.

We were the only customers, and I believe we were there right about 11:45. When our food was brought to our table by the owner, the other owner came out also and the two of them ""hung out"" and talked to us while we ate. That was a little weird.

Not before long, I became a regular, coming every week or so. I've tried many things on their menu and nothing has disappointed me in the taste category.

"You want it your way? Not at Choice. Ironic huh?

So, I love breakfast but am normally not awake in the acceptable timeframe for most restaurants.Today though I had an early trip to drop my boyfriend off at the airport so I decided to treat myself. I was going to go to the Market at Cheshire, but the clock was fast approaching the cut-off time as I was cruising down Clayton Rd so I quickly pulled into the parking lot here at about 9:58. 

First, I do have to say that the inside is adorable. It's very bright and fresh although the lovely soft music playing over a muted tv on CNN showing a story about a plane crash was a little disjointing. 

There was a chalkboard with a few items including scrambled eggs and a breakfast sandwich on whole wheat so I ordered the sandwich asking what came on it (scrambled egg, spinach, cheese). No bacon. Hmm, ok. I would like to add bacon. We're not talking total wacky pain in the ass customization here, just breakfast sandwich + bacon. Pretty reasonable, right?

Apparently not. Instead of a simple upcharge for adding bacon she CHANGES my whole damn order ENTIRELY to the Farmhouse BLT. Now this is on the lunch menu and has a sunny-side up egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on panini. Close but not quite. The kicker is I don't even realize this has happened until I think to ask what kind of cheese comes on the breakfast sandwich. That's when I'm informed that I'm not getting the thing I wanted and ordered, but something completely different. I get that the sandwiches are a relatively similar concept, but I wanted the fluffy scrambled eggs and whole wheat bread dammit. At this point I'm dumbfounded, but my coffee-less brain is still trying to process what has happened before I can insist that no, I do not want this new thing. I WANT WHAT I FREAKING ORDERED! At least I catch that my new sandwich had mayo and was able to get that removed. No mayo before 10am for this girl. 

Anyway, I ask about the cheese and am told the BLT doesn't come with cheese. (insert forehead slap) Ooookay, let's add cheese then. Mozzarella or swiss. I want cheddar. My total is $10.00. So, to recap this comedy of errors, I ordered a breakfast sandwich with scrambled eggs, cheese, and added bacon that was changed to a BLT with a sunny-side up egg and added cheese. 

I eagerly dig into my enormous to-go bag, retrieve my box only to open it and find that my sunny-side egg has slipped off the sandwich leaving the whole bottom of the box covered in yolk. At least the egg was cooked properly is all I have to say about that. Scrambled eggs would still have been in tact (grumble grumble). Growing increasingly angry about the entire breakfast situation, I pick the sad little egg white up, put it back on the sandwich and dig in. No. Damn. Cheese. The bread (white, not wheat) is also SOAKED in oil or butter like it was supposed to be grilled up, but never quite made it. That crap dripped all over my shirt. Gross. The sandwich pretty much sucked. I couldn't help but wonder what the sandwich I actually ordered would have been like.

The bacon, however, was absolutely delicious. Seriously, amazing. It saved this from being a one-star review. You should add bacon to every single thing on their menu.

We were delighted to find that Happy Hour was in effect from 3 to 6. In addition to half price drinks they had several selections of Bar Food available. We chose the house Chardonnay, Hot Wings and the Fish Tacos. Reasonably priced, they were all delicious. We sat and enjoyed the food and several rounds of drinks and were never rushed to leave. It was a very enjoyable time. The prices are reasonable and the service is exceptional and the atmosphere is pleasant. If you are nearby and need a place to chill out this is it. If I lived nearby I would come at least once a week. I hope we can come back someday soon.",5.0,2,2

Rachid is a hair wizard. I went to him to cut off my long locks and get a short bob with balayage treatment. He truly did a beautiful transformation. I came out of the salon feeling like a million bucks and the bar next the salon all clapped for me as I walked out complimenting my new do. Now THATS a great haircut.,5.0,2,2

"Barcelona wine bar is as every bit of fancy as the name suggests. The restaurant brings Spanish tapas into town, a unique addition to the southern saturated cuisine commonly found in Nashville.

Upon entrance, you'll find the atmosphere bustling with the edgey feel you'd expect from a new restaurant in Nashville. My friend and I came in on a Saturday night at 7PM so of course we expected a long wait. And a long wait we had indeed. We were told we would be seated for two people after an hour and a half. Since we were looking forward to eating here so much, we decided it'd be worth it. Luckily Legato Gelato and Taco Mamacita are right next door so we stopped at both locations while waiting for our seats. 

After an hour past, we decided we could wait back in the entrance to see if we could get a seat at the bar. We circled the bar area with no such luck...completed crowded. We proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...you can see why I'm giving a 4 star rating. 

Look I understand, it's one of the hottest new restaurants in town on a Saturday night at 8PM, and I was naive enough to not make reservations. I get it. However, I do believe that customers should be given a realistic timeline for waiting. We were told 1.5 hours, but we weren't seated until 2.5 hours later! I appreciated the hostess providing a quick appetizer to hold us over before being seated and that has at least salvaged the potential of another lost star.

Well...was the wait worth it? Yes indeed it was. My friend and I ordered 6 tapas. I can't remember all of them, but my most favorite were the shishito peppers. Perfectly salted, and, as warned by the waiter, had a spicy kick for every one in ten peppers. I was eyeballing the seafood platter, I have that on my hit list for next time I come back. And yes, I will be back in the near future.

Had a great time once we got seated so would highly recommend! Make reservations!",4.0,2,2

"Poor packaging caused damage to my announcements. They were basically just thrown in a large box and shipped. No protection or anything. The edges were all bent and when I received them. For the price I paid I would expect a quality product as well. The announcements were basically an 8.5x11in piece of paper folded in quarters. I've tried to contact Customer Service using the form on their website, but it's been a week and I haven't heard back from anyone. I'm going to try calling next week, but from the other reviews that I've read on here it won't do any good. The cost is excessive for the poor products and customer service.

"this was a good last minute brunch find for us. we miscalculated timing of when we needed to leave for the airport given saints traffic, so we bailed on our reservation and headed around the corner to Luke's. 

Server was very nice and the brunch menu had several appealing options. i enjoyed my shrimp and grits though could have used a larger portion (maybe it was just bc we had eaten nonstop during our trip and my appetite was extra big). i ordered a glass of prosecco that was just ok and my friends both said their bloody mary was just ok as well.

"I wish we could have tried this place, we arrived tonight around 6 without a reservation. We noticed the tavern part was very busy with a Christmas party. The host was very rude to us. He was very standoffish and couldn't give us a straight answer. We asked for a table and he said he couldn't accept walk ins because they had reservations. On another note he said he wasn't sure because he just sat 2 walk ins. That's fine and all but there were at least 8 empty tables. I understand if you have reservations but he didn't need to be rude about it and it should stand for everyone not certain people. Very disappointed because I've heard good things.

The sandwich was still super good, crispy, and warm. I didn't love the tomato soup - it was a bit too rich for me. Felt a bit more like sauce than soup, but the taste was decadent.

My boyfriend and I was in fishers and decided to finally stop and try Portillo's. I'm not a hot dog person so I just got their breaded sandwich with fries.

"Came for Mother's Day and Graduation and thought that the Captial Grille was solid. Our waiter was very friendly and professional but forgot small things like giving desert menus to the whole table, instead of giving menus to just a few people. 

The french onion soup is very large. I didn't think there was anything incredibly great about †he soup, but I would definitely think about getting it again. The Bone-In Dry Aged NY Strip is a decently large piece of steak. If you only want steak, it was fine, but I was a bit disappointed. When the entree came out, it was literally just steak on the plate. Unlike most other restaurants, there were no side dishes. I felt that the steak itself was good, but the dish as a whole was lacking.",3.0,1,1

"My wife and I had never heard of this place, but we were in a bit of a hurry (we were hungry), wanted Mexican and this was the first place we came across.  I don't think the people who come up with the meals for this restaurant have ever seen a Mexican dish.  

First off, I got a burrito.  Pretty hard to screw up, right?  The menu says, ""all burritos come with rice and your choice of black beans.""  Well, that sounded about right.  I chose black beans.  Next up, a 'sauce' for the burrito.  I assumed this was some kind of salsa, to go inside the burrito, so I got queso.  Sounded interesting.

My wife got some tacos and tortilla soup.

When we got home, here's what we had in the bag: my burrito, with rice and beans on the side.  On the side?  Seriously?  The burrito itself was impossible to hold, because they had dunked it in the queso 'sauce.'  Just what I always wanted: a burrito dunked in Cheese Whiz.  So they were 0 for 2 on knowing how to prepare Mexican food.

My wife's tortilla soup was in two containers, neither of them filled to the top, one container was all broth, the other was a fistful (i.e. a huge hunk, smushed together) of cheese, floating in broth.  0 for 3.

This place blows.",1.0,0,1

"Have you ever heard of a unicorn?  What about a mermaid?  Well, add Patrick Johnson as the third amigo to the trifecta of majestic, undetectable creatures.  

The only difference is you can see Patrick at Nashville's own Music City Autoplex (MCA.)  Lucky for me, while searching for a new vehicle online I stumbled upon a highly respected auto dealership that had an abundance of used automobiles.  This is typically an either/or scenario.  Normally you get a highly respected business with slim pickings or the stereotypical used car salesmen who are a bunch of (insert derogatory name) with a lot of choices.  Per the reviews online MCA appeared to have pleasant and knowledgeable salesmen with a great selection to choose from.  Thus my wife and I drove from Chattanooga with high hopes and several dealerships we were planning to visit.  Our first stop was MCA and we quickly realized it would be our last.  Upon arrival, the truck I had inquired about when I had spoken to Patrick days earlier on the phone was backed up in a front row parking spot ready and waiting for us.  We met with Patrick Saturday morning and wanted to test drive several other trucks on the lot as well.  We test drove them all (he appeared to be more than happy to let me test every vehicle if I had so preferred to) but we decided which truck it would be.  

We already had a preapproval letter in hand from a local credit union with an extremely low rate, however we let the financial folks at MCA give it a whirl and see if they could beat it.  Well, they did, and did so by a fair margin.  Our interaction with MCA, especially Patrick Johnson, Chris Wright and Adam Ellithorpe was wonderful and painless.  I would HIGHLY recommend this dealership to my family and friends, and actually already have.  We will be returning to buy another vehicle from MCA when my wife is ready for an upgrade.

"When I think of social the next word that used to come to mind is distancing, but after this experience my new next word is house. 

Are you tired of the same old song and dance of big box store chain sports bars pushing out mediocre food but charging twice the price? Social House offers an excellent alternative. With wall to wall TVs (currently featuring European soccer bc that's the best we got right now), and food that is so good, but inevitably will make you hate yourself even more than usual. Prime example, the waffle fry nachos. No chips here folks, just tender waffle fries smothered and covered in authentic genuine beer cheese that runs like a pack of mustangs over the plains of the potatoes accompanied by crispy bacon among other flavor profile protagonists. 

Burgers are the star of the show here. I went with a house favorite guava burger that was textbook sweet and savory. Guava jam as fresh as a farmer's market slathered on a steaming hot burg laid to rest under bacon. The Hawaiian bun was the real surprise keeping the balance of yin and yang ever so delicately under control with its light texture and sweet flavor. 

In summary, whenever sports return to the world to deliver us from the monotony of rerun TV sitcoms I will certainly find myself at Social House.",5.0,2,2

They give you a heart rate monitor to use to track the progress during the class. It is $89 to purchase if you decide to sign up. Class was fun. Good modern music. Pretty loud which I didn't mind. I liked the bathrooms, but don't think 2 is enough for the class size. I liked the post workout showers, but again 2 is not enough. I don't think the day use lockers are large enough if you do plan on bringing stuff to shower. Sales pitch at the end of the class. I didn't sign up. Yet at least. Although they take all of your information (including credit card information) and I got a call to make sure I was coming earlier in the day. I think they will continue to follow up to get me to sign up. 

Also, I liked that you get an email with your workout summary at the end of the class. 

Pricing (as of 05/16/2018) $99 for 8 classes/month.  $59 for 4 classes/month. $159 for unlimited classes. 
Pricing is $89 for 8 classes a month and $149 for unlimited classes if you are a St. Luke's Medical Center employee. Make sure you get that discount. 

Class times can be limiting for some so check the schedule before signing up. There aren't any from 12-4pm I believe during the week. And none after 12pm on the weekends. But they have weekday classes at 5am if that works for you.

The ricotta corn dip was delicious and served with Parmesan zeppole. The portion was appropriate for the price, but honestly I could have ordered two servings and eaten that for my meal!!

is good but Anthony's Coal fired is better and S'italy has the best pizza in N. Wilmington.   Service was kind of slow for salads, kids spaghetti and meatballs and a small
pizza.    

I can get larger quantity of better or similar quality salads at the diner across the street.   The pasta sauce, however, was pretty good!",3.0,1,1
One of our favorites.  Love that they are open early on Sundays.  Can honestly say we have never tried anything on their menu that we didn't like. I find that I actually crave their tacos.

"We are traveling from California with friends and found the Munch Factory on Yelp.  Being new to Louisiana food, we wanted to try something authentic.  Our waitress took the time to explain the various dishes and offered her suggestions for some of her favorites.  The four of us each ordered something different, and after sampling each others dinners, we decided that EVERYTHING was awesome.  From the appetizer of crab cakes, the corn chowder, gumbo, and main course, WOW!  And if you decide to go, don't pass up the bread pudding.  We were all full, but had to give the bread pudding a try....  the BEST!",5.0,2,2

We were already there over an hour because this guy forgot about his lunch and then he came back and just set the to go box on the table and didn't say anything to us and walked away.

"Poor service not enough employees working this happens often get more employees or I will not come back.  Always at happy hour and today was wine specials all day!!!! Well the place was packed the waiter and waitress were working their assess off.
My friend from Europe had to wait for over 30 minutes for a glass of wine. I had to summon the manager who was super nice he did the best he could he was even working behind the bar.  Then we proceeded to b the restaurant we had a wait for 15 minutes  yikes if we would have known we would have eaten elsewhere.

The above was in October 2015---well I went back last night 5/5/2016 food is good service still slow.  The waitress who was the Bartender was killing herself and there were only 6 people in the bar.  She is also servicing the restaurant.  I do not want to wait 20 minutes between drinks and food.  Later there was another guy (I guess asst. manager) who did not wait tables only helped ring up.

He apologized and I don't even know why. What a kind person! Just judging by how honest and kind the staff are, I'm pretty sure that I will be ordering from them more often. Judging by the reviews, this restaurant really tries to cater to their customers. That is a pretty rare find these days. No matter how good the food is at a restaurant, if the service is atrocious it can leave a bad taste in your mouth. This place deserves more customers than it already has :)",5.0,2,0

"This place is overpriced and overrated, even with food satefy issues.
We had 4 people, and per yelp review, we ordered the cheese plate, and for main course we had shrimp and scallop, roasted duck breast, pork belly, and steak. Here is why it is totally not worth the hype:
- The complementary appetizer (though not the main subject matter here) tastes like normal croissant we can get in a bakery, very unimpressive for such an upscale restaurant
- Most importantly: 2 of us got STOMACH UPSET after the dinner. At first I thought it was just me or something to do with my own main course, but the next day my friend told me she had the same issue. She felt really sick and even threw up after going home.
- The portion is small, combined with the food quality, would make this way overpriced ($34 pre-tax for a main course). I live in Philly for 2 years, and pretty sure that there are plenty of other restaurants with either better quality or value for money.",2.0,0,0

"I was going to post negatively about this restaurant due to a customer service snafoo that I will now not go into detail on. However, since the food is always good, and the Owner/Manager on duty has since apologized, Im inclined to give it a solid 4 star.

They get mega points for authenticity and taste. I lived in Chicago for a few years, and got to experience great Greek cuisine. One owner of one such restaurant there said that if it didn't taste iike home everytime, he would pack up and leave. And most of the food here is on par with that. 

I've chosen to largely forgive the service I received on my latest visit, because ignoring the issue (since resolved) with the Owner/Manager, the cashier/service people who I talked to before the issue were great! They were very helpful and eager to take my order. 
I had initially gone in to inquire about this locations history and the experience these two were having  here as compared to their previous jobs, and to order something small for the road.  To which they had only good to say about the owners and the conditions. 

There are two other things that I think they could improve on. One, the locations appearance. Im not going to judge it too much, because in our current economy small business owners have to be conscientious about space rent and such. However, a remodel or some painting or brightening up would probably go a long way. 
The other is a better drink selection/ self service. I think they might benefit from a fountain machine for drinks, like the Gyro Co. down on baumgartner and meramec bottom. Again, I won't really hold this against them because I'm not aware of the cost management of that vs. what they currently do. 

Overall: This is a great authentic eatery. Im glad that the owner(s) are able to keep going during these times when it's hard to do so.",4.0,2,2
"As another Peruvian, these were my observations:
1. Jalea: wrong flour used. This dish is supposed to be crunchy at every bite, instead it felt like fried tortilla. My guess is that they used corn flour instead of regular ( not acceptable in my opinion).
2. Small portion: a little overpriced for the amount. I only say this because most Peruvian places serve more than you can actually eat; therefore, my point of view could be a little ""biased"" as a spoiled customer.
3. Slow service: food took too long to come out.
4. Lomo saltado: on point, i must admit it was good.
5. Shrimp Causa: $10 for a very small portion worth $5-$7 tops.
6. Bathroom: really dirty and smelly with no toilet paper.
7. Passion fruit: it is simply juice and ice. Based on the simple fact that water in Nevada is very filtered, so the ice taste pretty bad.
.
Very small improvements could make this place a much better restaurant.",1.0,0,0

My husband and I and some friends had lunch there yesterday. As always I ordered the ""monkey on a stick"" appetizer. Yummy tender beef cubes somehow served rare despite their small size. 

When I ordered the BLT the waitress asked how I'd like the bacon cooked -- never been asked that about a BLT before. The sandwich was huge with tons of bacon, as was my husband's Big Kahuna burger. Both were delicious.

"Hello, it's the ramen snob again. See my previous ramen reviews if you like. I'm gonna follow my own general template for ramen places. I've been here twice now on a Sat and Sun (yes, back to back). First, the non-factors but still worth mentioning. 

- Wait time for food was slow and took about 20 min to show up. Yes, it's opening week so some leeway is to be expected. 

- Service is friendly and cheerful but not super ""professional"" in that things are pretty disorganized. Whether or not that's the fault of management or servers themselves, I don't know. 

- Decor was nice. Felt hip and minimal at the same time. Plenty of loud music. Felt like a well-lit Ippudo.

- Plenty of space and tables.

******  On to the food

Broth - 1st visit I went with tonkotsu. Broth was light but creamy in texture. It was an interesting combination that I don't recall ever having. Good for certain folks, but I want a stronger flavor in soup base. 2nd visit I got the spicy tonkotsu broth. I don't know why I ever get spicy versions of anything because it just kills any sense of ""flavor"".   5/10.

Noodles - both times I got straight. Taste-wise they seem pretty standard. They were relatively chewy, which isn't my preference (I learned things are semi customizable after my 2nd visit).   4/10.

Cha-shu -  Both times, the pork was flat out not good. Clearly they bothered to roll what appeared to be pork belly but didn't cook it anywhere near long enough because it was much too chewy and way too lean.  Thickness of the pork was too thick also (may be a preference thing again). Moreover, quantity of cha shu seemed less than I'm used to as well.         1/10

Toppings - Came with red ginger, menma, and a slice of naruto. Don't remember any nori sheets either (which I thought was standard usually). Egg is a dollar extra. Corn is an option too - maybe a first in Philadelphia?  4/10. 

Price - Basically NYC prices, which is too high due to *not* being in NYC and current food is not worthy of the better ramen found in NYC.  Yes, it's UPenn, but it's still a college campus and the more value-oriented customer may not bite.   3/10

****** 

Oftentimes, I need at least one strong element out of the 5 listed above for me to be satisfied. 

Unfortunately, they did not deliver and overall I give them a 2.5/5 stars (if that was available). They have potential if the waitress was correct in saying your ramen broth and noodles are customizable. However, their pork preparation/style needs fixing - reduce slice thickness significantly and increase fattiness slightly/moderately (or have a fatty slice option if you want to retain the lean cuts for other customers).

A strong effort by the young chef, but things need improvement. Would I return anytime soon?  Not likely. Terakawa is by and large my go-to ramen spot now and I happen to live only a few minutes of walking distance away. I'd recommend people to make the trip out to smelly Chinatown and give it a chance.",2.0,0,1

"I am not Vietnamese... but over the past year or so, I have become quite a fan of the food.  I live in Pennsport, and thus have tons of access to the restaurants on Washington Ave.  In trying a few of them, Nam Phuong has risen to the top as my trusty-go-to spot.  

We brought a newbie with us on Sunday night, and will thus review this experience.

Walking in, the smell is certainly unique.  Having eaten here on numerous occasions, I love it.  It's sort of soy-saucey... or what our friend described as a mens locker room, or a wet dog.  The decor is kitschy, but somehow it works!  The bar you can tell was newly renovated as its AWESOME, but not a sit-down bar... more of a take out counter.

We got seated at a nice sized table for 4 people by the window and were promptly given water, and asked about drinks.  Beers are $3 for domestic, $3.50 for imports.  YES PLEASE!  

As a vegetarian, my options are a bit limited (per usual).  I always associate most Asian dining (Indian, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese etc.) as being veggie friendly.  They embrace tofu!  What more could you ask for?  You need to watch your back if you're a vegetarian at Nam Phuong though.  You might as well just tell your waiter.  If you order 'Veggie Pho"" you will get chicken broth.  The proper technique is to ask for Vegetarian Noodle Soup... which is the exact same thing with broth that is safe.  I also like 253.  Not sure what it is called formally, but its fried tofu in peanut sauce on rice vermicelli and shredded lettuce, pickled carrots, cucumber etc. and some steamed veggies.  I like the contrast of fresh/cooked/hot/cold etc.  Its delicious.  Again, they bring out this fish sauce that they expect you to dump in there, so you have to be a bit wary.  

This specific dining experience, I went for my trusty 253, pushed the fish sauce aside, and seasoned with rooster sauce, and a bit of soy sauce.  AMAZING.  

Per usual, i hit the bathroom before I left, and per usual, it was DISGUSTING!!!  It always makes me nervous what the kitchen looks like, but I try not to think about it.  the floor was soaking so I almost fell over.  I literally put down paper towels to try to get traction.  You are discouraged from putting toilet paper into the toilets... not sure why... as Philly plumbing can totally hang with toilet paper... but whatever.  The trash cans are overflowing, the stalls are dirty etc.  Better than some bars, but the decor is nice, it's just not clean!

Also per usual, you have to flag down a waiter for a check.  They will almost never bring it automatically.  The sooner you accept that, the more pleasant your experiences will be.  Once you flag them down, they bring the check promptly.  Just a cultural divide I guess.

While Nam Phuong may not be the fanciest, trendiest, most upscale place on earth, its a fan favorite!  You almost never have to wait, the prices are reasonable, the service is fairly good, and the food is PHENOMENAL.  Will be back... always... and forever.",4.0,2,2

I feel like we shouldn't have had to pay for this, but we did pay. And my husband said the cheese steak was just okay. I unfortunately wasn't able to eat, I have a shellfish allergy and the pizza had a lot of shellfish and they weren't able to accommodate the allergy. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the second slice of pizza that came out apparently was very good. Sadly, I don't think we will be back to this location.",2.0,0,1
"A friend posted a pic of his food and it looked so delicious that I insisted on trying this place.  Let me preface by saying that the food is good.  What I ordered was delicious.  However, why we won't go back is the price point.  First of all, the menu is very limited.  Second, it's ala carte.  Who does ala carte Mexican food?  While the food is good, it is EXTREMELY over priced.  We ordered the chili rellenos and the chicken enchilada.  On the chili rellenos, you had to pay 1.50 extra for cheese, which we did.  If there was a teaspoon of cheese added, we  would have been lucky.  While the flavor was good, it was a small pepper stuffed with corn, beans, and squash on top of maybe a tablespoon of rice for $15.  Really?  The enchiladas came 3 to an order - they were small and shoved into a 8oz baking dish.  They did come with a side, a whopping 2oz order of unseasoned black beans.  There is so many other places to get good Mexican food - Panchita's, Taqueria Guerrero, just to name a couple where the food is just as good and a much better value for the money.  The cost of lunch for 3 ppl, was 50 bucks, that was with all of us drinking water and no appetizers or dessert.  Fifty bucks for lunch at a Mexican place - really?

I have been to several Jack Furrier locations and have always had a good experience. I took my vehicle in to have an oilchange and replace the light bulb in the main head light assembly.

The insisted that they needed to remove the battery and the battery case to be able to remove the bulb and place the new bulb. They said that the bolt in the battery case was stuck and they couldn't remove it . But the could guarantee the repair because if the remove the bolt and it breaks it would need to be tapped . I would up just replacing the bulb myself it took 10 minutes . On my vehicle you just need to pull two tabs on back of   the headlight assembly and the head light comes out allowing you to replace the bulb. They were either stupid or just trying to run up my bill. Either way I would not recommend this location for repairs. I will not be returning.,2.0,0,2

"When you AAA is there for you, THINK AGAIN!!! 
I arrive to this office well before closing and am denied service. I had shoes and a shirt so it wasn't that. There were at least 6 workers in there sitting and standing and staring at me so obviously they were not doing anything! And they were all listening to Gail tell me that they are only accepting payments because ''DMV
stuff takes too long...''
Well damn isn't that why I pay for membership and insurance?!  Or is it just for the catalogs I get in the mail? 
There are
Absolutely no signs that say ""We only do payment services after 5:30 Mon - Friday's and we only do payments only after 1pm on Saturdays"" . If there are signs then I missed them. I drove hours through rush hour traffic and more for a ""sorry maybe tomorrow!"" That doesn't reimburse my gas or time. This AAA is 48 miles away from my home... and all they will say is ""sorry"".

"On Yelp, a 2-star rating is ""Meh. I've experienced better,"" and that fairly encapsulates our visit to Datsa Pizza.  My family and I really enjoy pizza, and with such a humorous company name, and high expectations set by those who had rated it before we felt it was a shoo-in.  The service was great, we were seated immediately.  No matter your seat, you have a great view of the kitchen as your food is prepared.  Our server was also quite fast with refills and tended to us quite well.

I ordered the Summer Breeze, which I had thought would have crumbles of feta cheese and nice, moist slivers of red onion.  What I received were a few small pieces of feta and one or two fairly crisp pieces of onion.  This could be expectation versus reality, but I think when you advertise a topping there should be more than what was given.  My brother ordered a small pizza, which was largely crust.  He was quite glad he had ordered a salad to supplement what little he had.  My Mom and sister ordered a pizza that they liked but didn't find outstanding but ate without complaint. 

I think this is a good place if you want to support local businesses, live in Indianapolis,  or nearby.  For us it was good, but not necessarily outstanding.",2.0,0,1
"I'm so disappointed,  I just ordered a Ruben sandwich, and I know from ordering Rubens in the past what it has in it. This ""Ruben"" was on marbled bread,  not rye, the corn beef was cut not shredded,  the sauerkraut was missing the dressing and it was not toasted. I don't know what kind of sandwich this was but it certainly wasn't a Ruben. It's also expensive and well worth it when you actually get what you ordered. Check out the pictures, by the way it was a really small sandwich. This order was placed through Instacart.

"Dinner at Jack Rose was an experience worth repeating, as there's so much to love about this place. 

First things first, there's the decor. From the artwork to the millwork, to the color choices, to EVERYTHING - this place is unique. I also love that it's a little on the loud side, so you can feel free to talk above a whisper and laugh out loud.

To kick things off I had the endless summer cocktail.  OMG. That little nugget was delicious!! And seriously potent.  I especially appreciated the coconut rim. 

We ordered a Ciabatta for the table and I went with the short rib as my main.  Both were impressive, and I'd definitely order them again. 

The only disappointment was the mile high pie. I must have misread the description because I wasn't expecting ice cream. I'm a huge pie lover, but am not crazy about ice cream. My bad. Next visit I'll try a different dessert. 

After dinner we headed up to the rooftop bar for another cocktail.

"Nothing but a waste of my time....

I came in at about 10:15 this morning hoping to get my eyebrows waxed as I was sick and tired of dealing with the pain of threading. The lady at the front counter advised me she had just sent someone out for 5 minutes and could I please come back in about 15-20 minutes. I assumed ""sending someone out for 5 minutes"" meant that she had allowed the staff member who would be doing the waxing to head out for a 5 minute smoke break. I thought it was odd considering the mall had just opened at 10:00 but left my name and browsed in another store for 10 minutes.

I came back at 10:30 and was shocked to see the lady I had talked to at 10:15 working on another customer and chatting with this lady as well as another lady sitting in a neighboring chair. Upon seeing the annoyance on my face all she had to say was she was sorry and that the lady sitting in the neighboring chair was the person she had agreed to see in 5 minutes and would need to be served before me.

Okay if it was infact a customer you had asked to come back in five minutes and not a staff member then would this lady not have forfeited her spot when she showed up after the lady you are currently working on? Also why was it okay to serve the customer in your chair before 5 minute lady and not me?

I really got the feeling from how they were chatting and how friendly they all seemed that these other two ladies were either friends with the staff member or more regular customers and therefore got more preferential service.

It was a really odd experience that left a terrible taste in my mouth and I definitely wont be back.",1.0,0,0
"Greg was responsive, courteous, and most importantly, gave a fair price.

Before the visit, Greg spent time reviewing some photos I took of the areas of concern I had, and the work that I thought I needed. 

I was debating whether to upgrade my 100amp to 200amp service, and Greg helped me understand that the upgrade was unnecessary at this time, given the current requirements in my 1350 sf home. When does a contractor talk you out of work? I appreciated Greg's honesty here.

In my house, the box covering the wires coming in underground and the greenfield conduit running from the box to the meter have some rust on them, and I was concerned about their condition. Greg did a full inspection on these components and concluded that they also didn't need to be replaced as well, because there wasn't evidence of recent water damage and the wire inside was in good condition. Again, more money saved where another contractor might have just repaired for the sake of the job.

Finally, I did need a proper grounding system installed on my 100amp service and Greg efficiently installed a grounding rod and ran the wire to ground my water pipes, gas service, and cable connections.

And Greg gave me fair pricing for the time he took to do the job (~2 hrs). Other contractors were pricing me at 2-3x the rate that Greg gave me. 

Greg has his customers' best interests in mind, and I will definitely call him back whenever I need electrical work.",5.0,2,2
"Disappointing. They forgot my mother's meal after 45 minutes of waiting for food to come out. I can understand if it was busy and backed up but they weren't. On top of that, our food was cold.

"Wow, what a disappointment. My boyfriend and I finally went F.Scott's after living here in Nashville for more than 10 years. We knew it would be expensive, and we were prepared for that. It was my birthday, and therefore a special occasion. Firstly, we were a little surprised when were seated. It was very quiet with carpeted floors that created a very awkward ambiance as we were the only ones in this section of the restaurant, other that one other couple that was about to leave. We could barely hear remnants of the jazz band coming from the lounge. Our waiter greeted us, and he was very friendly and offered several  recommendations based on what we typically like. The wine was really good, and it was actually very affordable. The bread and rabbit confit came first. They were both wonderful. Although we were not crazy about the atmosphere, we were excited about the food and our upcoming entrees. When our food (scallops and halibut) arrived, they both looked ""ok""...nothing extravagant.  Unfortunately, that's how they tasted as well. The food was just...underwhelming. I have no problem with small portions sizes (and they were small), but I really want the food at that price it to knock my socks off!  I've had much bigger and tastier scallops at other restaurants for less $. Nevertheless, we finished our food and then took the remainder of our wine to the jazz bar. The band was great, but there were very few people there. The waiter informed us that they do have a bar menu, but we can also order from the dinner menu in the lounge if we return. So, with all of that, I will say that the food is good, but severely overpriced (especially when there are so many other great restaurants in Nashville that are in the same price range); the service is great; the wine list is exceptional and affordable; and the atmosphere in the restaurant is ""blah."" If we return, we will be sure to sit in the bar; have a bottle of wine; and order the rabbit confit and maybe a couple of things from the bar menu. You live and you learn....",2.0,0,1

"Last minute choice, and we were surprised at how much we enjoyed it!  I was skeptical due to the fact it was all vegetarian. BUT Gokul served really enjoyable dishes and different compared with other Indian Buffets. 

The Saag Paneer (which is a dish you do find frequently) was magnificent.  There were chunks of cheese mixed with the spinach. The cheese was light and blended in with the dish wonderfully.  My first plate was the best, filled with Pav Bhaji (potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, and peas w/ tomato, onion and spices), Saag Paneer (spinach), Aloo Began (eggplant and potato with Indian Spices), and rice with a slice of naan. 

The second plate included more lentil type dishes but all were runnier than I would have liked (Yellow Daal  and Makhani daal - black lentils).  The were not my favorite selections, but worth trying. I recommend putting the runnier items in a bowl and using the naan to dip and enjoy!

"So I have not yet gotten my tattoo. I simply came in for my initial consultation, but I must provide a review simply because of my personal first impression.

This will be my first tattoo, and with such a commitment I wanted to ensure that I found the right place that would be patient, but additionally fully understood what I am looking for in a piece and place their own twist on it. I mean, not everybody understands when I ask for them to make it ""dark"" or ""gothic"". Thus, the journey through yelp began. Scrolling through different places and reviews, I came across this hidden gem.

My consultation was with the fabulous Pepper and she was simply amazing and personable. She was patient and answered all my questions, and even questions that I have never really thought about. Moreover, she educated me on the process and provided me information on aftercare. Just the simple notion in educating me makes me relieved and comfortable. 

Pepper asked me various questions to ensure that she would provide me a sketch that would match what I was looking for - and I trust that she will blow me out of the water! Yet, what made me the most confident in her skills is the truth she spoke in ensuring that I am comfortable. 

As stated above, this place is a gem and I am glad to have discovered it. Furthermore, I am looking forward to the masterpiece that will be provided by Pepper to proudly wear and the future projects it may start.",5.0,2,0

"On past trips to Ming Kitchen I would say that it is average Chinese food at best, but decided to give them another shot last night. I placed my order and was told that it would be a twenty minute wait... that turned into about a fifty minute wait.

The fried rice also had the same scorched smell and taste. Both containers of the General Tso chicken tasted old and stringy.

Perfect sicilian style pizza in my opinion.
Also had the greek salad which was fresh and great flavor to the dressing and feta.
Now for the ""boat"".  The boat is an attempt to make a calzone.  Avoid it.   There is too much dough and not enough cheese.  I asked for olives and they dumped like a whole jar of olives into it so that I could not taste the sauce and cheese.

Three chicken was huge, which is fine, but there was only a small leaf of lettuce (about a 1/4 the size of the chicken and 1/2 the size of the roll) and a 1/2 of a slice of tomato. As we ate, hubby nearly done, we are batting away flies. I even overheard the elderly couple behind me comment about how they should have brought fly swatters. Meanwhile, hubby bites down on something hard in his sandwich... It was a thin piece of plastic, about an inch long.

"We celebrated 3, October birthdays at Station 6 for lunch. We saw the soft crab special on several previous reviews and so much wanted to try that.  When we arrived at the restaurant, it wasn't on the lunch special. Our server, James, said he would check with the chef on the soft crab special, since it was end of season and may not be available.  When James returned he said they had a few left and 4 of us ordered them.  My wife ordered the charbroiled oyster pasta and my other friend ordered the sloppy drew.  NO ONE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR MEAL.  The soft crab meal was outstanding, fried to a golden brown, generous portion of lump crab topping, crisp asparagus and the red potatoes were excellent.  And the sauce, I wanted to lick the plate but restrained myself.  The charbroiled oyster paste dish was delicious, with more than a generous serving of oyster prepared to perfection. A large go box was needed for the remainder.  The sloppy drew sandwich was very generous with the roast beef, was moist tender and juicy.  The bread pudding dessert was to die for.

"Three minus stars overall.

Look, as an Asian, I'm probably going to be pickier than most on Asian restaurants. And as someone whose parents were both born and raised in Hawaii, I'm going to be pickier than most on Hawaiian plate lunch spots.

It's OK, but nothing to write home about, especially if Home is Hawaii.

That said, our party had the shoyu poke bowl, Kahlua Pork, curry chicken katsu, and a butter mochi. The poke is actually really fine. Nice array of ingredients. Colorful.

The Kahlua Pork was not bad, not the best, it wasn't tough or dried out by any means but it wasn't as tender or as moist as Kahlua can be, not as flavorful as it could be, and it was pulled on the coarser side: Three + stars. The curry chicken katsu, which there was a TON of on the plate, was not breaded with panko, so therefore in my book, it doesn't qualify as a katsu. The breading it had was OK, almost crispy enough, but still lacking. The curry sauce itself was too mild and almost didn't have any curry flavor. I'm sure they must use Vermont House brand or Golden Curry brand curry roux. No one makes their own Japanese curry roux. So why was it lacking flavor? And it was not chicken breast but thigh. Japanese chicken katsu is made with a flattened and pounded chicken breast: Two minus stars. Finally, the butter mochi was for me....weird. First time I've had it. It was a butter-infused square of mochi with a coconut topping. The flavor reminded me of a coconut macaroon. The other (non-Asians) in my party didn't care for it that much. I really didn't like it, but you might: One star. The mac salad our meals came with was acceptable as was the white rice. Nothing that sent shivers down my spine, but good.

The service was very good. She took our order, was attentive to our needs, checked on us, and cleared our table: Five stars.

The menu is somewhat small, in my opinion.

So, definitely go for the poke bowls. Not for the katsu or butter mochi. Maybe for the Kahlua pork, you will probably enjoy that.

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.
4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.
3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.
2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.
1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!",3.0,1,1

"After years of waiting the terrific mural finally gave birth to a pizza place and it seems like they weren't spending the time thinking about how to make pizza. I can't imagine anyone longing to return for this ""meh"" product. A signature pizza should be unique and memorable the one we had was neither. Also, staff seemed woefully untrained. The bartender came out from behind the bar to help the lone server so our beer was M.I.A. while we waited. If all you've got going is beer and pizza you should get one of them figured out.

"I Have been in Business for over forty years. I have never in my life been treated with such disrespect in my life by the manager in that facility. I unfortunately lost a front tooth and decided to go there and receive a examination and be fitted for a temp tooth. When I completed my first visit the attendant put together a cost we had to agree on I paid for half the cost then and would be the other half of the balance when I came back to have my temp tooth installed. After 5 days of taken of work and not doing anything because I was embarrassed, I went back excited to get my temp tooth. I walked in and the women manager said that she would not honor the agreement what I was told and that I would be forced to sign up on there plan which would cost me much more money. She said that is what it is and if I would like I can refund part of your money and I will send the tooth back. I said I feel like someone has a gun to my head. I said refund and I will write this review, she did not care. If I was able to rate this establishment at ZERO I would.

"Great creole / Cajun food and warm heated service. Had two entrees: Shrimp Etouffee, and Jambalaya rice. The good part is the store owner offer free sample to narrow down the choice. And best part is, most of the entree can be made vegetarian (the owner informed they add meat to roux on-demand!).

Jambalaya rice was perfect blend of spices. Shrimp Gumbo was slightly less spicy, but adding little black pepper and salt made it better. (Though, Yats @ Franklin makes best Shrimp Etouffee... See my review for Yats). Both entrees were so good and tasty that I ordered another White Bean Chilli (vegetarian) to go.

"Had two same experiences. 

I had gone to grand opening and and the wait time wasn't 't too bad. I had gone with friends and our server seemed to have little to no training. It was not busy and we waited 10 minutes for service. Along with that, the server almost spilled water on me. The portions of the food compared to US is smaller with a high price point. Our server also had over charged us as we requested to split the bill and she had calculated the math wrong. She never gave us the receipt with the total and the break down. 

I went back the second day with family. We ordered their $9 drinks where you can keep the cup. The drinks were filled 3/4 of the way for 2 of them and one of the cups didn't light up. It also too our served 15 mins to come take our order. Along with that the music was so loud that I was not able to hear the server properly. Rather than coming closer to me in order to hear my order we were shouting across the table. When my food came out, it was wrong and one of the servers was telling me it was right when it wasn't. My mom had asked me to try her food and the same server who got my order wrong came out of no where to tell me to stop eatting her food and eat my own food. I paid 22 dollars for 3 peices if shrimp and overly salty fish.",1.0,0,0

"Has changed ownership in recent years, but the basic idea is pretty much the same. Enormous slices of pizza (only plain is available except on Mondays I think?), but you can get whole pies with toppings if I recall correctly. Costs about $3.50-$4 for a slice, but it is about the size of 2-3 regular slices. Quality of the pizza is pretty good, but it won't completely blow you away. Much fewer places to stand than there used to be with the ownership change; they want people in and out quickly.

A week later, a new (more minor) problem arose...I dropped my car off with him again, told me he *might* be able to look at it on a Thursday (we called on a Tuesday afternoon), but by early afternoon on Thursday, it was all done and again the price was very reasonable!

"I wasn't sure what to think when I ordered a bowl of bun bo Hue soup and the waitress gives me a blank stare and tells me she doesn't speak Vietnamese. It's right there in your menu, bun bo Hue. From the city in central Vietnam that was the imperial capitol.

I almost laughed when I saw they had two kinds of bun bo Hue: Vietnamese style with slices of beef shank and pressed pork and an American style with thin slices of lean beef. What about the cubes of congealed pork blood that is a staple of this flavorful soup with a lemongrass-based broth?

The Vietnamese style was flavorful and compares well with what can be found in Portland. The best in that city comes from the restaurant named after the soup, Bun Bo Hue. But the one from Pho Nouveau, even without the blood cubes, would fit into my top 10 from Portland. 

The service on the other hand, was uneven. Not as bad as other Yelp reviewers have experienced. But nothing to rave about. The waitress who took my order never came back to see what I thought of the soup. Maybe because a different waitress delivered the soup, she figured she was no longer obligated to me. She did bring back my bill, but didn't thank me or ask me whether I enjoyed my lunch. Same thing when I got up to leave. Didn't say a word. 

I saw a man who appeared Vietnamese come out of the kitchen a couple of times with soup bowls in his hands. I assumed he was the cook and that he knew what he was doing. It showed in the soup.

I went somewhere else to get it fixed (referred from a family member this time) and the stylist took before and after pics of my hair to use as an ad for her website saying ""i fix bad haircuts.""

A lot must have changed in recent times. Had a party of 10 with a reservation at 7 on a Tuesday night.

No one got drinks till 30 mins later and half the waters were missing. Frustrated, we just put all of our orders in after literally flagging down our server.

We were served much later. No one enjoyed their food much either. Sushi was rolled loosely, the rice was dry and hard, fish was not fresh. Not a single roll was memorable. Perhaps it was the bad service that killed our taste buds.

"Penrod Arts Fair is in tune with the times. An end-of-summer tradition for my family for years and years, Penrod is among Indianpolis' top outings. Visiting the grounds of the Indianapolis Museum of Art themselves is worth a trip, and Penrod makes it even better.

"I've dined in at Hattie B's twice and ordered their food via Postmates several times. I must disclose that I'm pretty sensitive to spice, so I just stick with the ""southern"" style, rather than opting for the traditional ""hot"" chicken. I love their tenders; they offer the perfect ""crunch"" on the outside with juicy meat on the inside. Delightful! I only wish they had a few more side items. I usually end up with a double order of macaroni and cheese because I'm not a huge fan of black-eyed peas, greens, potato salad, beans, etc.

If you go at a peak time, you will likely have to wait in line (outside) to get in. Their wait can be a bit long, and there's not always enough seating to accommodate all the guests inside. I'd say this is the best place to get your ""Nashville hot chicken"" experience.",4.0,2,2

"It's been a few months since I had my Toyota but now that I've had a good service experience, I know just how terrible Toyota's was. I bought a 2015 Scion tC when I showed up to test drive it they had two and didn't even know which car I was there to drive or if I was in the right car when test driving.

Before test driving the car my dad had called the sales manager who he had spoken to a couple of months ago while looking for a car for himself. When we showed up and my father introduced himself as the man who had called earlier and come in a couple months ago the man looked so lost but you could tell he was trying to play it cool. This was kind of awkward to me that he was being dishonest right off the bat claiming he remembered when he clearly did not. 

When I finally got to look at the car I was there to look at (mentioned the confusion above) they had told me they had just cleaned it all up and buffed it for me. This was in fact TRUE! They had buffed it into oblivion, more spin marks than I've ever seen. I stupidly ended up buying the car regardless after they claimed they'd take care of it. I took it back in about a week later for them to ""fix it"" and all that came from that was them having my car for 2 days and getting it back worse than I had given it. 

A little while after that I started hearing a weird rattling noise coming from then engine so I pulled into the closest gas station and popped the hood. Next thing you know I see a drill sitting on top of the engine (see picture). Trust me I wish I was kidding but seriously a DRILL?? Batteries plus engine heat is not a good combination. When giving the drill back (since my dad said most service people buy their own tools) they acted as if it was no big deal. Honestly infuriates me even thinking about it now. 

My first car was an 08 automatic tC and I can't remember a time that I was happier than when I bought the 2015 6 speed tC but for me at least Beaman muddied my tC and overall Toyota experience and only cared about the money out of my pocket.

"My lovely husband and I don't get to have many 'date nights' so I'll take brunch with bae any day! 
The decor in this place is clever, it's all made with white washed pallets to create an entrance way, the kitchen front is the same and the walls are covered in drawings and graffiti from customers. The tables are quite funky too and it looks like a lot of love went into this place.
Mimosa obvz, it was big and bubbly and delicious. I tried the Big Red sandwich; smoked corned beef, pickled daikon, honey mustard, mayo, on toasted Russian rye. There was so much meat packed on this. It was delicious with the right amount of sweetness to it! My husband had the burger and we shared the Pirate Poutine. The poutine gravy is vegan friendly and very peppery. We got a large between two and it was perfect.
Service was relaxed and friendly, we were even handed a Sharpy to leave our mark on the wall.

"I can't say much about the Cafe' portion of this establishment, as I've only ordered desserts, but the baked goods are some of the best in the Media area. The pie is delicious homemade goodness, and much better than anything that you could get at a supermarket or local food store. The muffins are very good, and worth getting if you're looking for that kind of food in Media. 

However, by leaps and bounds, the best thing that they serve is their sweet potato ice cream. Despite it being fairly hidden on the menu (if there at all), this is the most unique ice cream anywhere near Media, and would be worth getting extra to bring home. Before judgement is past solely on the name (sweet potato... in ice cream?), let me briefly describe the flavor: it is a mix of pumpkin pie and cinnamon, which go together in a heavenly combination. All in all, this ice cream far surpasses the local standard, and is absolutely worth getting any time of the year.",4.0,2,2

"We use to love Texas Roadhouse. We would go at least 3-4 times a month. Great food, great atmosphere, friendly waitresses..... Until our last visit a few weeks ago...ugh. The hostess brought us to our table, with a kids menu. After we got situated at our table, my youngest daughter opened up her silverware napkin pack to begin coloring, and out ran 2 roaches!! She let out a small scream, and we all jumped and squirmed as they ran across the table and up under it. We immediately slid out of the booth, and I know other customers sitting around us have had to have noticed what was going on. We obviously told our waitress the problem as we made our way out of the restaurant. FYI, The waitresses grab that silverware right where they have the meat on display by the hostess stand in front of the kitchen, so you know there have got to be roaches back in the food preperation area and they make their way into the silverware wrapped napkins. So disgusting, I still shiver thinking about that evening! We will NEVER return, as much as we liked their food before, it makes our stomachs turn thinking about it. We'll stick with Codys on SR54, and I hear there may be a Longhorn Steakhouse coming soon to the area, thank God!!",1.0,0,2

"Attended an event at the Merriam recently for a performance that my family had been looking forward to for weeks.  What a disappointment.  Seriously the WORST theater experience I have ever had.  I won't repeat what others have said about the cramped seating space, but that is definitely a valid complaint.  Two issues here - 1. When people pay good money to see a show, what is the need for them to be checking social media and texts during the performance, and having your optically-bright white screen annoying and distracting all of your fellow patrons?  Our seats were a few rows up in the balcony, and in looking around throughout the balcony rows as well as down at the orchestra section, there were countless lit rectangular screens throughout the audience.  More importantly, why isn't theater management doing anything to discourage such patrons from acting like such boorish classless and clueless citizens, to ensure that a positive experience is had by the majority of the patrons?  It's not like it is hard for management to see the lit phones to be able to address the issue quickly.  I have not ever seen this be such an issue at any other theater I have ever been to.  2. What is the point of having multiple signs posted throughout the building that no photography, or audio/video recordings are permitted, if people are not prohibited from recording during the performance?  Having everyone with their phones out and recording the performance is annoying for fellow patrons nearby with the bright screens in front of you or in your peripheral vision.  Additionally, one would think that the creators of original programming showing at the Merriam would want to take specific steps to prevent their event from being recorded - if someone can just record the program and then their friends/family can watch the pirated recording and not have to pay money to buy tickets?!?!  Well, perhaps it's for the best - the boors who would watch such illegally recorded footage are probably the same folks who would be scrolling through their phones during the performance anyways, and annoying all of the other patrons around them, so perhaps it's better they stay home and watch the shaky grainy illegal video recording....  Merriam, thanks for the show, but I will not be back.  There are too many other great theaters in the metro Philadelphia area (as well as NYC just a short train ride away) with terrific programming to ever subject myself to your second-rate theater experience again.",1.0,0,0

"I was told when coming to Nashville to try out Nashville-Style Hot Chicken, and this was one of the spots that a lot of folks clucked about. I was forewarned about the line situation. I think to wait in long lines for a singular food item, like hot chicken or cronuts is such an interesting human behavior but as you can see from the majority of the reviews, folks don't have a problem with it. 

A friend and I had just eaten breakfast and decided to mosey over and be first in line before they opened up. As we waited the line grew and grew 'til it snaked around the side of the patio and down the block. While we had scoped out the menu and had an idea of what we wanted to eat, no one prepares you for the pressure of being first in line (of nearly 50 people by the time they opened their doors). Risa did it right. If you have any issues with ""order fright"" as I like to refer to it as, order to-go and two-step passed the line. 

Walking up to the counter once the doors swung open, I saw Chicken & Waffles, and was like, ""oo, can I get that?!"" Chicken & Waffles is only on Sunday, folks. After fumbling a bit, I ordered a Small Dark Hot! with potato salad and cole slaw. My friend who was equally flustered ordered Chicken Tenders Southern-style, and tripped up over ordering her sides, and asked the cashier to just pick the two best sides. The cashier wasn't really looking to help out my buddy, and yes there was a line behind us waiting for us to complete our order. We got her sides in, paid, and...we didn't get a ticket or anything, so we kind of felt like chickens in a coop just standing around. It definitely is an order, grab, go-type spot with little staff interaction from what I can tell. That being said, it's efficient and the folks were pleasant that put together our order. 

Maybe eating on their patio is the way to go (it gets a bit claustrophobic/packed and the cooking aromas are quite strong inside). This way your chicken is still hot, you can order a beer to drink with your chicken which I'm sure is delightful, and maybe really experience Hattie B's. We took ours to go. The chicken was well-cooked, the heat level was tolerable and good, but I wasn't blown away. The sides were also good, but not anything to shake my tail feathers at. 

I know a three-star review isn't the majority here, so take the suggestions of ordering to-go (but still eating on their patio) with a cold beer to enjoy your hot (hot) chicken and other suggestions brought on by five-star reviews, and you'll probably really enjoy your experience! I am no Nashville Hot Chicken connoisseur but if I do return I'd like to try them out again along with other NHC high standard spots.",3.0,1,1

"oh my god, if i only i can put 1/2 star

I had the WORST experience here at so called ""Happiness"" Nails & Spa

I just moved to IV, so I didn't know of any other nail places so I waited for exactly 20 minutes. (The manager named Phu at least said sorry)

They had me wait for this girl named Anna, I guess known for acrylics. She was busy, so this other guy started my acrylics. Absolutely gross. He had sweaty ass hands :(

FINALLY Anna was ready to do my nails. She was fucking horrible. Where the hell did she get her training done?

1) a lot of tugging -___-

2) her nails were long and sharp. I kept twitching in pain and making ugly faces...and she kept going and going and going! Just pushing the skin by my nails down with her long sharp nails

3)I'm fluent in Vietnamese, so I understood EVERYTHING they were saying, This other chubby Vietnamese lady was hovering Anna and I, and kept complaining in Vietnamese on how long my tips were...BIITCH, I'm the customer if i want them long, let me have them long...Then she was talking about how my white glitter powder on my tips didn't even look like white glitter (they were pushing me to get silver earlier). AGAIN you freaking work at a salon, i am the customer, this is what i want, stop complaining. The chubby, vietnamese lady was also talking shit on the customer by me. God, you work at a salon, show some customer service!
 
4) 2 manicurists just kept hovering over me. I felt uncomfortable and squished :(

5) THE BLOOD! blood was oozing out of the skin by my pinky nail. She completely saw it, since she was doing my nails. No fucking sorry, no ""hey you're skin is bleeding! let me help you out"". NOTHING

6) O the agony, when I left. My finger tips started burning and throbbing! I had to sleep two nights with ice on my hands. Thank god I live with my boyfriend, if he wasn't there I wouldn't be able to do the simplest things like..open a bottle of water -___- ugh 

7) Scabs on my fingertips........

8) I wouldn't be doing this HUGE RANT, if Phu (the manager) just called me back. I came in a couple days later, and showed them my bloody scars on my fingertips! Asking for a refund. Phu told me he would have to ask the owner and he asked for my info and told me he'd let me know whats up. I told him that If i couldnt get the refund then I can just get nail salon credit (or w.e)

It's been 2 weeks!! NOTHING AT ALL. o yeah im pissed off...57 dollars worth of shit, blood, and scars.

"We came here for dinner after a long day yesterday and left so disappointed in our service that we will likely not be back. We were a group of 3 and ordered drinks, an appetizer and 2 entrees. Our drinks came out quickly, but everything went downhill from there. We waited approximately 30 minutes thinking our appetizer would arrive shortly. However, when our food arrived it was the 2 entrees we had ordered and NOT the appetizer. One of the entrees we ordered were fajitas, and while they brought the fajitas they did not bring the tortillas out with it. We had to wait another 10 minutes before we could flag down our server to tell her we didn't get our appetizer and that they forgot to bring us the tortillas. How are we supposed to eat the fajitas without the tortillas? And what happened to our appetizer? I could understand if this was an honest mistake, however what happened next is the reason for my bad review. The manager came out to our table to apologize for the missing appetizer order and said he would take it off our bill. A nice gesture, right? However what he failed to mention was that it would be taken off our bill AND our order all together so basically his nice gesture was to have us not pay for something we never received anyway!!!

It is hard to write a review for this place because while some of the food was amazing the experience was not a great one. We were from out of town and found this place 20 mins away on yelp and the food looked good so we decided to give it a try. I liked seeing two couples on the patio spaced far apart. When I walked in there was a lady behind the bar on her cell phone. I waited a minute or two with no greeting. I said hello and she finally came around to the register. She rang me up and while I was signing for my food I noticed I was charged a different amount then what I was originally told on the phone. I still left her a great tip for pick up given the fact that most restaurants have been closed. She comes back and tells me that she accidentally gave my order to someone else. She told me they would have to remake my order. She asked if I wanted spicy bbq sauce or regular. I asked for both since it was our first time. She placed 6 bbq sauces in the bag however none were marked. The beef ribs and the garlic cheese curds were amazing. The tri- tip was good but I did ask for medium rare and got well done. This was probably because they had given my order away. Baked potato looked like an old potato that had been sitting in the oven all day. Mac and cheese tasted like a box that they just added extra pepper. All the food was warm and fresh except the Mac and cheese. It was like that pre-made containers and left in refrigerator until ordered. I'm assuming they typically heat it up but this was not. I don't think this is a place I would drive out of my way for again.,2.0,0,1

So decided to try them tonight, but had to cancel order because we have to be at an appointment at 7pm and traffic sucked. I felt bad that we didn't have time and should have planned it better. Wife called them to cancel and was told, ""We already made it. F*** you."" Couldn't believe it, so she called back, asked for a manager. Manager then yelled at her, said f*** you and hung up. Just a heads up if you ever think about eating there.",1.0,0,0

"Our first night visiting this bar was a ten. Lawrence was spot on with customer service and wit.  However, when we returned, while staying at The Aloft, we were greeted with a half assed bartender. Almost always missing, this guy could care less with his approach on customer service. He was lackadaisical when it came to taking our order and checking on us. He consistently served others while we waited with empty glasses and when he finally found us at the end of the bar, he almost acted as if we were troubling him for his time (even though he made a drink three times for the gentleman next to us.)  We left dumbfounded and frustrated. Thankfully we are leaving tomorrow.",3.0,1,0
"I used to think this place was overrated. I still feel that way about the food (except for those damn pickle chips!) tonight's service though, was great. Already nervous about having the kids with us, starving, during Lent at a burger joint, I was hoping for a miracle. Thankfully, the place wasn't busy and we were seated immediately and greeted by an really personable and sweet server. Even though our order was wrong and the food that did come out was cold, she was great, accommodating and reasonable. The manager was on point, using his sweet personality and noticeably kind body language to make us feel that he genuinely cared that everything was a mess (not a hot mess, mind you. Hotness can only happen when the food is fresh). 
Kudos to awesome folks working at a mediocre establishment. We probably won't be back because this always happens here, but if we do, it's because of them.",3.0,1,2

"I had had a tremendous experience living at PF for my first year of business school, and while the apartment quality is still high (see previous review), during my 2nd year at PF the quality decreased significantly specifically with customer service. 

My rent went up 30% because I signed a 6-month lease. I understand that less people move in during the winter, but was disappointed that despite the rent increase, service quality actually went down. 

Rather than be inmediately responsive like before, I would have to email multiple times to have something fixed. I requested my shower head be replaced, for example, during Thanksgiving break, only to return and find the task had not even been started. I had a plumber come in to fix my clogged sink, and he left my bathroom a mess, scattering all my belongings. Mac did not check in with him to follow up on the status of the repair, leaving me in the dark. 

Within the online portal, I could specify which time I would like repairs made. I would specify in the afternoon, as I work from home in the mornings. Not that it ever mattered, because maintenance repairs would always come in in the morning.  

During move out, management asked if they could double schedule another move out and requested I share the freight elevator, even though I had reserved the elevator by email and gotten a confirmation a month prior. 

Even escalating the issue was a pain. Management was slow to reply and refused to issue me a credit for all the inconveniences without providing a rationale. I don't feel like my loyalty to this building has been valued.

The negligence has also extended to safety. There was a break-in into the guest parking area behind the building a few months back, and another once in December 2017. It seems as though management did not do enough to prevent it.  

With so much new construction and new competition in the rental market, PF simply can't afford to be complacent.",1.0,0,0

Try not to sit next to a window in the winter or you'll freeze. Maybe that's the hostess's fault. 

Hangar steak was delicious and cooked with a nice sauce. 

Home fries lacked crispy edges and tasted as though they were pre cooked and sat in a large hotel pan and scooped out of a trough and put on a plate. The scrambled eggs were premade and had no salt and pepper. They were also quite cold. Fried eggs were made on a dirty flat top. Duck hash was hilarious because the same subpar cruise line potatoes were plated with a couple pieces of duck on top.

"My boyfriend and I found this gem of a coffee bar while in-between breweries.
 From the outside, you can barely tell it's there. Once you pass through the slightly disconcerting mosaic tile entrance, you are surrounded by natural, clean, Hardwood floors and furniture, and welcomed by a very laid-back and kind staff. 
Most coffee shops close just when I am out searching for my caffeinated-second wind. So I was grateful to discover that win win is open until 2am on weekends. I got a coffee to go, but found myself reluctant to leave! 
    The coffee was delicious, and the selection of allergy friendly creamers was adequate. I especially loved trying oat milk for the first time! 
    It's rare that I write about a bathroom in a review on Yelp, but the bathroom at win win just can't be ignored. There is only one, but it's creatively decorated. It's also a little trippy for those who have been drinking! The double wall of mirrors draped with twinkly lights gives the illusion of continuity and makes the room seem very large and slightly fantasy-like. 

Thank you, win win, for keeping me sufficiently caffeinated, and for upping my spirits with your welcoming staff and ambiance.",4.0,2,2

"CHUCK - E - CHEESE! Kids running amok through the place! Not at all up to Open Table standards. This is the eatery for the Holiday Inn that's attached to it. My GPS had no idea where this place was.

The hostess greeted us with a sneer. What is up with maitre de's not smiling. That is so rude! When we gave our the hostess led us to a table. The people immediately behind us were ASKED if they wanted a table or a booth. We were not given the option. In a very big and empty place, we were led to a table right next to a child who was misbehaving. He was screaming and climbing all over the booth. It was so bad we could not carry on a conversation. The parents thought it was really cute that they got up and were walking the kid up and down the floor next to us. They would look at us and smile like they wanted us to stop our meal and tell them how wonderful their kid was.

A man who appeared to be the manager was chatting-it-up with two other tables. He begrudgingly came to our table during dessert. He barely even slowed down to ask us how everything was.

The booths were low because they lost their springiness. The tables were extremely high.

The crab soup was way too salty!

The veggie burger was ok as far as veggie burgers go.

"it was meh. not big on cheesesteaks but my friend visiting from ca wanted to try it. and we decided on this spot because, a) she wanted to go somewhere touristy lol and b) geno's is racist. this was our last stop before she left back for the west coast and we decided to make it for lunch, after hittin up the magic gardens. 

surprisingly, there wasn't much of a line. i'm assuming it was because we stopped in during lunchtime on a weekday. there were still more people here than across the street at geno's. 

anyways, i got the mushroom pepper cheesesteak with provolone. it was ok. i can tell the ingredients were fresh and clean but the meat wasn't seasoned so it was a little bland. the service was also just meh. 

it's def a touristy place that i would take any out of town friends visiting but i prob won't go out of my way to check in here again. esp since i hear there are plenty of other better cheesesteak spots in the city.",3.0,1,1
"I have not been to this place for ages.  Actually not since it moved so it has been a long time.  I always remember it as being pretty good and we had small children at the time and it was a place we felt comfortable bringing small children.  I was actually a little excited because it had been so long and I was starving and shopping at Winco when you are starving is a bad idea.  I am not a yelp person and believe I have made a comment once before on any web site but I could not let this very overall poor experience go.  I ordered two slices of pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  The cashier said ""so you want one piece with sausage and one with mushrooms?""  I replied no, ""I would like both pieces with sausage and mushrooms on each piece."" The cashier said I could not do that.  She stated ""One topping on each slice is the rules.""  I simply said ""That's funny, I can't get extra topping and pay extra.""  She stated I could get a side of an extra topping and put it on myself but they would not do it themselves.  Understanding, that she is just a kid, probably a student, trying to make some extra money I did not engage any further and simply ordered two pieces of cheese pizza.  I gave up on the toppings.  I seated myself and tried figure out a reason that a pizza place would not put an extra topping on my pizza and simply charge me for it.  I understand that for their single slice pizza one topping is included, but for the life of me, could not understand why the employees are prohibited from making a pizza the way the customer wants it and charging accordingly.  Anyway, my slice of cheese pizza took ages to serve and was approximately 25% burnt on the bottom.  Not crisp but black, burnt. The amount of cheese and sauce was almost non-existent.  I basically got a piece of burnt bread (crust) I come from New York and this was not New York Pizza.  Maybe this was an isolated experience.  I hope so.  I would give negative stars if possible.  I am not a confrontational person so I just left but thought the owner might read this and do some training or policy changes.  I was in on Sunday at 0100.",1.0,0,0

"I am going to copy and paste both my old and updated review as I think it's important to see the difference in experience. I am hopeful that with the old Gm (who was well known to be ignorant to customers including me in my original review) gone and the new ownership this place will become a favorite again. 

Update:
Wow what a completely different experience! They are under new ownership and they have taken out the trash that was the previous general manager. The lettuce wraps are now back to iceberg so we were able to enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps again. The broccoli at the market bar was cut up into nice bite size pieces instead of the giant half chopped pieces it use to be. Everything was full at the market bar and we were even asked while up there if we needed anything refilled. They also had an employee working very hard making sure the market and sauce bar were clean after each person went through (seriously shout out to that guy he's a great hard worker)! Our server was super on top of everything and had new drinks for us before ours were empty, plus he quickly got any extra sauce we asked for. The noodles are still the thinner kind, but I think they may be trying to use up what they had left and will hopefully move onto a thicker lo mein noodle. All in all it was a much better experience like what I remember stir crazy use to be like and I look forward to the changes to come! 




I've been coming here for 15 years starting out on the kids menu. It use to be one of my favorite restaurants but no more. Why change something that isn't broken?? The lettuce wraps are now made with romaine lettuce.. that doesn't even make sense. The ""lo mein"" noodles are now just soggy thin spaghetti noodles instead of the thick yummy noodles it use to be. I assume they're trying to cut costs but I strongly believe this will be what ruins them. Get it together and go back to your old suppliers.",5.0,2,0

"Cobb Realty authorized entry to my home to a prospective tenant at any time. When the prosepctive tenant came to my home around 6:30pm they attempted entry around the border of my home as well as garage entry.  They claimed that employee, Stacey thought the property was vacant and authorized them entry.  Upon arrival they still must have thought it was still vacant despite my car being in the driveway and my dog barking in the home.  I thought I was being robbed. I was fearful and upset when I found out Cobb had authorized eveything.  To my knowlege, they are not even supposed to be sending perspective tenants to homes unescorted much less after normal busniess hours.   This type of unescourted permission to enter a property could result in theft of owner valuables such as appliances and house furnishings as well as personal thefts.  I do not recommend using Cobb Realty as a property manager for the security of the goods in your home and personal safety.

"Finally tried The Hub's food for the first time tonight.  We had a reservation so there was no trouble seating our party of 9.  (Note: Parties of 8 or more have auto 18% tip.)  Our waiter was friendly and helpful esp. with substituting and giving ice cream advice, even going so far as to give our whole table a sample of the Thai Coconut to try because we were all curious.  I had the Vegchetta sandwich and substituted the coleslaw for a cup of tomato bisque(+$2).  The bisque was thick and had a rich flavor.  There was some confusion over two Vegchetta sandwiches--one w/portabello and one without.  When the server realized the mistake, he took one sandwich back to be remade and brought out the missing ingredient for the other promptly which was appreciated.  The sandwich was okay.  Perhaps I am spoiled with Beyond Bread's Maya's Market, but I thought the sandwich could have had more veggies and also more of a unifying sauce or cheese, as it tasted a little bland.  Overall, I would go again to eat, but with the drive and parking it definitely wouldn't be my first choice.

"Yum, who doesn't love fried chicken and donuts?
The first time I heard about this place were from teachers in my school talking about it but I just thought it was a mythical place because the name was never brought up. I forget how I found the name but it doesn't matter because donuts.
I've tried all the fresh donuts here and it's so good on a winter's day (as I reminisce in July). Hot cakey donuts covered in crunchy flavored sugar. Also, their coffee is pretty good. If you want fancy donuts, go there early; I like a lot of them, but some are misses (I had a surprise half-dozen and didn't know any of the flavors but one of them was covered in a deep-red glaze, and that was the only one I didn't like).
Onto fried chicken...also try that. I had it plain just to see what it was like and it was one of the best breakfasts I've had. The honey donut that comes with it was really good, but  you can't get any to go. I would get a dozen honey donuts. The pickle was nice to look at.

Awesome little communal table/bar area and small but intimate dining room. The menu is limited, but well executed. All the protein was cooked perfectly, the sauces flavorful and rich and the sides were innovative.  The steak had a bit more of a charged taste than I appreciate, but that's just a matter of preference. The wine list leaves a bit to be desired, but we found a decent, inexpensive bottle we enjoyed.

"A group of about 10-12 decided to try this place for happy hour.  Several of the people in our party were smokers so we sat outside in the unseasonably warm weather.  It was spitting rain, but there was a roofed gazebo we were sitting under so no worries.  The smokers would go out of the gazebo to smoke as they were told this was the rule.  

The waitress was just, off, somehow.  She wasn't very friendly and seemed overwhelmed and confused by simple requests like, ""Can I see a menu?"" 

About 30 minutes in, she came out and said the forecast was calling for storms and lightening and would we mind moving inside, but we didn't have to hurry, we could finish eating.  Several of us had ordered food and about half of us were eating under the covered gazebo.  We said, no problem, and continued on.  

About 10 minutes later as we were finishing up, she came out again and said she was getting off her shift and did we want to close out with her or transfer our tickets to another server?  We all said we would close out so that she could get the tip money.  

She split our bill up, ran our cards and brought them back.  During this time, she also delivered another food order to us outside.  

By this time, the sky is clearing and looking like the weather had passed by.  
Another 10 minutes go by and she says, ""My manger is about to come out here and be really rude to you if you don't go inside.""  

We responded by saying, ""If that's his plan, then that's a really bad idea.""  

She went back in and immediately the male manager/bartender came out and YELLED, ""You have to come inside now, our insurance won't cover you being out here.""  He was incredibly rude.  Since we had all just closed our original tabs anyway, we all left and went to another bar.  

I will never go back.  The wings were overcooked and salty (the trainwreck style wings) and the service went from being sub-par to just flat out rude.  

There are a thousand different ways to handle this, the easiest would have been when that last food order was up, the waitress (or whoever our new server was going to be) could have said, ""Would you like me to get a table set up for you guys inside for when your food comes out? "" 
 
With a group of 10-12, a little assistance figuring out where to relocate would have made everyone's life a lot easier.  Instead they lost a group of folks who are looking for a new happy hour venue, spend lots of $$, and drink all evening.  To top it all off,  most of us are former service industry folks.

"Pretty nice atmosphere but if you're seated downstairs it's pretty crammed. 
*Limited menu. 
*NOT friendly service- kind of snooty. 
There's signs up everywhere about their votes for ""Best Burger' yet there are none listed to order from the dinner menu. 
Upon entering we were told we were having ""lunch"" but then, once seated, they handed us the dinner menus- I suppose since it took so long to be seated the menu had changed to dinner. 

2 adults + 2 kids who split their entree= over $200 with tip. BTW for my entree I only ate a salad. TOO much Money for a Unmemorable, Unfriendly meal. 

It served its purpose that day, but I won't be back. 

*I did mark that there is a full bar- but there is a very limited selection of beer. They didn't even have Corona-? Strange. Plus if there's more than 1 or 2 of you- good luck waiting at the bar- it is next to a service door, we were there when it wasn't very busy, yet, always seemed to be in the way.",2.0,0,1

"5 stars for the brewery itself. The drinks are fun and they have a ton of different options that they brew, from beers to wine and sangria. 

However, the staff were not so great and it was just awkward. We were visiting from out of town and literally everything closes in this town by like 9 or 10pm on a Saturday night....so weird. But this brewery was open til 11pm, I believe, so we stopped in at 10 when everything else was closed. We were like in a time warp. There was one group of drunk patrons in there (imagine the people still around at last call normally around 2am) but they left shortly after we arrived. Then the staff began to shut the lights off on us multiple times while we were sitting at the bar. They couldn't wait for us to leave....poor service.",2.0,0,1

I explained that I didn't mind waiting, but he certainly minded me waiting. My last visit I took my wife. My wife asked him what kind of breading went on the fish. He screamed at her, saying that he only had one breading, and asked her what she expected? We walked out and I haven't been back.",1.0,0,1
"Sir Pizza is known as Pizza King in the Midwest  and is the pizza I grew up on when visiting my grandparents' farm.   

It's very different in subtle ways to the pizza most folks know from other chains.   
--Their ingredients are all chopped finely.  No slabs of green pepper, no round pepperoni, no crescents of onion.  
--They use provolone cheese instead of mozzarella. 
--The pizza is covered by ingredients.  No ""crust handle"".  All the slices are rectangular except for the four triangles at the corner.   

I've seen several people compare this to Totino's.  I think the chopped ingredients (as far as I recall Totinos is the only frozen pizza to do this) is what lends them to make this comparison.   Because that is the only similarity.  

A Sir Pizza/Pizza King pie is full of pizza flavour in every bite.  The ingredients and assembly work together to make sure that each bite is PIZZA.   None of this chomping down on a fistful of sausage or a ""fresh"" mushroom wilted by the heat.    The smoky provolone compliments the toppings without overpowering them.   
The thin crust is a delicious foundation without the overpowering yeasty tang you get from Papa John's or the greasy and often unevenly-baked Pizza Hut offerings.   

I admit im biased because I have eaten this style of pizza for more than 40 years.   But then again...any pizza you love eating after 40 years is obviously a good pizza.   

And the only pizza I'll drive to pick up is this, Sal's or the Chicago style from 312.",4.0,2,2
"Went here this morning to pick up a few dozen donuts for my staff/customers, the lady that took my order politely asked another staff to help her fill my order. The manager looked up and asked why would I be so inconsiderate to not call in and why they (the 2 staff members) took the order. I asked if there was a problem the lady said no she's okay to fill my order. I could still hear the manager complaining about me, so I told them to go ahead and cancel my order and I'll go to another Dunkin. 

Went to the one on Collier who had a line out their door and they were extremely polite and fulfilled my order with no questions, complaints or eye rolls. I should add that this location had no one in line, maybe 2-3 cars in the drive through. Collier had a full seated area, over 10 cars in the drive through, a line out the door and were calling out numerous online orders at the same time. Through their chaos they didn't even bat an eye at my order.",1.0,0,0
Working in the area gave me a chance to check this place out Friday night. Invited fiancée down for dinner which turned into a night including a perfectly prepared dinner and a night of partying on their new patio. Don't know if it was a special night or not but live music on the patio all night worked well. Servers though a pretty busy night seemed pretty much on task as well as the kitchen.

"Maybe I'm not the observant, but this store looks a lot like the store that was here before.

I really like having more than just one store available downtown, and Kroger's prices are typically better than other options. I came here the other day and spent $13 for two meals... I thought I forgot to ring something up because I wasn't expecting it to be so cheap.

This store has a parking garage, so if it's raining or snowing, you can get to and from the door without getting wet. The produce section is large, but if you're looking for something special, you might need to go to another store. I was looking for seranno peppers and cilantro here and couldn't find either, so I had to make an extra stop on my way home.",5.0,2,1

"Taziki's has made me believe in second chances. Let me explain.

I first had Taziki's as take-out. Twice, in fact. They were mildly disappointing both times- I had gyros and the taziki (in the name of the restaurant!) was too sour and the sides were not impressive (particularly the rice). They were skimpy on the lamb and the pita wasn't as soft as I was hoping. But this was also when the restaurant just opened, and I am comparing to Athens, one of the better Greek places in the area.

But then, this week, I ate in at Taziki's and it totally redeemed itself. The service was prompt, the hummus was delicious and I ordered the oven-roasted pork tenderloin, which was amazing. The salad with the dressing, first off, was really quite good- the dressing was perfect, not too sour at all. The pork was cooked well and the aioli was SO good. Perfectly complimented the pork, rice and asparagus. Wow! I am so glad I went back. I probably will stick to the entrees like the pork rather than the gyros, but I was happy to get a great, delicious, satisfying meal eating in.",4.0,2,0

I asked if they could bring me rice since it's an integral part of the meal, and the person on the phone huffed very annoyed and put me on hold. I was waiting on hold for about 10 minutes before someone else answered again and asked how could they help. The first person handy relayed the message or anything. I was so frustrated that I just said nevermind. I ended up making my own rice. $90 spent and still ending up having to cook. I will never make this mistake again.

"A group of 15 of us went here recently for a Christmas luncheon for work.  Love the ambience and decor in the place and Ernesto, the owner, was the perfect host.  

The antipasto platters were beautifully presented and full of good stuff... cheeses, meats, pears, roasted peppers, olives, etc.  Sardines too, I think, which not many people seemed to like LOL. 

I had a nice BLT on good bread with avocado and a spicy mayo... I think it was chipotle mayo, but I didn't taste any chipotle... It had just a subtle heat to it which was perfect.  The fries were awesome - I just wished I'd had maybe 10 more of them or so LOL.  Seriously though, they were really big actually homemade fries so the four that I had filled me up.  I also had a side salad which was some nice mixed greens and grape tomatoes with a balsamic type dressing.  

Overall, everything was great!  We were really surprised that only one other table was filled while we were there... Hopefully it fills up more at dinner time.

"Sadly I write this as I visit Tony's regularly until today. As usual the bartenders are fabulous. My problem is with the manager and the food. We had a $70 lunch and it was terrible. The items ordered I have had several times before but today they were horrible. The $14 scallops consisted of 4 tiny scallops wrapped in more bacon than seafood/-way over priced as they normally serve huge scallops. The bruschetta on the pizza tasted horrible as if there were sweet peepers in the bruschetta, it was nasty!  Typically we finish the whole pie, today it was torture getting through a slice. The biggest problem was the manager. When we questioned the difference in the items we usually order, she hid in the back and refused to talk about the problem. She was apparently too afraid to discuss the issue or too disinterested in the customers (frequent customers I will add) satisfaction to show her face. Also had the same problem with her a few months ago when asking a question about a menu item change. She is a horrible manager and Tony's should give her the boot if they hope to retain loyal customers. As for me, I've had enough and it will be a long time if ever that I return. Seriously $70 lunch for 2 people that was terrible??  Sorry, until the management improves I will spend my $70 at Churchville Inn or one of the many other quality restaurants in this area!!  I am disgusted with Tony's!!!",1.0,0,0
"Usually the pinnacle of any bachelor party is the Saturday night steakhouse dinner, and this is where I had mine. An absolutely sensational choice by my brother. We enjoyed every facet of it!

Service: Waiters are fast, kind, and incredibly knowledgable about the food that they offer. It was my first time trying Wagyu beef and I learned much more about the meat than I had anticipated. Our needs were always met instantly and no request seemed like a burden to them. They also gave our group a complementary trio of fries, which was delicious!

Views: Of course you come to this steakhouse for the food, but the views don't hurt either. Bourbon Steak offers a 360-degree view of Nashville. Whether you come here for dinner or just for a drink, you will surely not be let down as you see what the Nashville skyline has to offer.

Food: Like I had mentioned earlier, I tried the 8oz American Ribcap Wagyu steak (~$90). I wanted to try the A5 but even a 4oz of it was $128. Eventually I'll try it but the ribcap was a great dish. The executive chef at this restaurant, Michael Mina, flies around the world to hand select where his meat comes from. This dish was so simple but cooked to perfection. If you get a steak from here or any steakhouse, I recommend it being no more cooked than medium rare in order to enjoy the meat. Wagyu has equal meat as it doesn't fat marbilzation, and this dish here left me speechless. One of us got the chicken dish and he too was left satisfied at the end of the night.

Definitely recommend coming here for dinner or just a drink. Service is great, views are spectacular, and the food needs no introduction. Can't wait to be back!",5.0,2,2

Looking forward to trying them.  I started at the top of the list and tried their Church of Roger.  Light and crisp, very cider like

"Our tour guide, Evie, is the reason I'm giving this a 5 star rating. Ghost tours in general are not my thing but I went with some friends that really wanted to go while we are here in New Orleans. Evie immediately had my attention. She was friendly and fun. 

When we started the tour she gave us some great history about New Orleans, the people that settled the area, and about what we were going to see. It really set the tone for the whole tour. 

All of Evie's stories and histories were fascinating because she is a good storyteller. When we went to the cemeteries she almost had me looking for ghosts. My group really had fun. If you get the chance to go on this tour ask for Evie for the guide, you won't regret it.

When we would come upon other groups I was glad every time that Evie was our guide. The other guides seemed less enthusiastic and seemed like they were just doing a job. You can tell Evie enjoys what she does.",5.0,2,2
"This place was a pleasant surprise.   I missed Cinco de Mayo, but their sign was still up on seis, so I stopped in.  

Clean and pleasant restaurant. 
You are served a great salsa and a small dollop of refried beans with ""a less than generous"" basket of chips.  On the menu it says the first serving of chips are complimentary and refills for the chips are $2.   I thought that was both an unusual practice and kind of expensive for such a small portion of chips (and there was only one person at my table.) 
The chips did not make it through the salsa and a very kind server asked if I wanted more, but another basket would have been too much and I certainly was not going to spend $2 to use up a couple of tablespoons of salsa.  
This is my only criticism of this restaurant.  

The food was pretty good and their special for Cinco de Mayo made it even better. $3 beers and the tacos al pastor were the special for $10.75. I could not finish the special, it was good but had I been charged the regular menu price for this meal,  I would have thought it was a little spendy for  ""ok"" Mexican fare. 

All in all, I am happy to have finally gotten to dine at Fiesta Guadalajara.  It is an ok  stop, but I probably will not go back.  I am a frugal restaurant eater and I expect a lot more for the money.",3.0,1,2

I like the pizza. My kids like the pizza and the breadsticks with nacho cheese. We get the pepperoni feast. We don't eat it all and the leftovers are so good when reheated in a conventional oven at 425 degrees. I've never seen the store but will venture out tonight to pickup the order. I'm scared. Will I be disappointed by what I observe and therefor never patronize my nearby pizza king ever again? I'm prolly just gonna get it delivered. It's cold and windy outside and my clothes are in the dryer. I'm not lazy- just worried about meeting people who make my food sometimes. I like the mystery.

"I try my best not to knock a place too terribly, but damn, this place needs a checkup. First and foremost, we were not greeted with super friendly service. That's just a rough start for me after working in the service industry for so long and receiving amazing service at other places of this kind. 

Secondly, and possibly worst: no coldbrew on the menu at this point in the coffee biz is a no-no. I ordered tomato basil soup and a small chicken ceasar and I could barely eat it. Soup was cold (and tasted like it was from La Madeleine, which is across the street) and the chicken on the salad was so obviously warmed up in a package in the microwave it made me sad. My mom said her chicken salad was mayo-heavy and very blah; the coffee was as bland as the service. 

Third...the bathroom. Did someone throw up in there before me and just clean up as best as possible? Or has it been this bad for a while? Roll was out and a fresh one was laying haphazardly on the table in front of the toilet. Just not a good scene.

One tip is to come hungry - you get more than a meal's worth of food!  You can't turn it down because it is all so good!  The second tip is to go on this tour early in your visit.  Mark gives you many recommendations for dining outside of the tour that we made use of.  If we had come later in  our trip we would have been disappointed that we couldn't use his local knowledge.

"Yum! It's the same delicious food from the creative minds of the Nude Food truck. They have just evolved to a brick-and-mortar shop in Little Italy Wilmington, Delaware. I haven't posted pictures of their juices because I wind up drinking it because it's so delicious, I forget to take a picture. I recently had their pineapple mint, which is amazing. Understandably their priority is this business not so much the truck, so as of right now, the Newark location for the truck has been put on hold. That was their home base for quite a while.

When going to food truck events,  I'm mostly disappointed in the selection of just fried greasy options. There is an organization called the Rolling Revolution, which is like a food truck union in Delaware that some food trucks belong to. But there's almost like a clique happening now, with the same food trucks going to the same events which I just don't even attend.

Hopefully this brick-and-mortar place will do well and I will make an effort to try to get up there but it's not as convenient as it once was at the truck. But you got to support people who are making an impact for the positive even if it's a little inconvenient.",5.0,2,2

"After several trips to Nashville I finally tried Hot Chicken.  Bolton's was sticky and a dive.  The wait for the food was lengthy.  They ran out of several sides.  However, the Hot Chicken was delicious!  It was hot and fresh out of the fryer. I'll definitely come back for more Hot Chicken from Bolton's.  I may even try it Medium next time.  I went with Mild just to test the waters.",4.0,2,2
"I just stopped in to browse the other day.  I was just about to go eat lunch so I was only going to get something if it totally leapt out and forced me to, and I got REALLY close but in the end was able to control myself and left without a purchase.  The woman behind the counter was cheerful and friendly.  She greeted me and asked if she could help me and offered me a tiny-bite-sized sample of their apple pie.  The pie was good, though not so fantastic I had to have one before leaving the store.  What looked totally incredible though were the croissants.  I nearly did buy some of those.  The almond croissants, for example, had a sugary paste on the outside that kept the large number of almond slivers on and I wanted to eat that so badly.  The chocolate croissants were perfectly formed and baked with just a bit of browning to them that made them look phenomenal.

I hope to come back sometime when I'm hungry and don't have lunch plans already.  I'm looking forward to sampling more and taking something home!",4.0,2,2

"A friend and I came for dinner because we were looking for dining options open past 9pm. The favorable reviews caught my eye, so we decided to give it a try. We are SO glad we did! We started with the pork potstickers , five spice chicken wings, a duck noodle dish off the special menu and some chicken fried rice. While we didn't get too creative in our orders, we were so pleased with all of the dishes! Everything was delicious, I can't wait to go back and try other items. The service was friendly, and Kwok came out from the kitchen to check on the diners which is always appreciated! It's a small space, so it probably fills up quickly on busier nights. So glad to have found this gem in Reno, and I'll definitely be back!",5.0,2,2
"This place was recommend by an old colleague of mine who frequently dines here. I wanted a romantic, wonderful spot to have my birthday dinner. So we read the reviews and asked her to make the reservations. She said to sit in ""Dan's section. He is great!"" Hmmm ok. When we got there. I was a little concern bc most of the reviews said you still had to wait a bit even if you have a reservation. But honestly, we got there right at 8pm and we wait 5 mins for the host to get back to his stand, and then next thing you know, we're being seated. I don't know if perhaps bc it was the middle of the week or what, but we didn't have to wait at all. Score! 

So we sit down and immediately the waiter for this section comes out from the kitchen and goes straight to the table next to us. I immediately knew that was Dan because of how personable he was with the other patrons. He had quite the sense of humor, and went above and beyond with all the guests. (so now I understand why my colleague mentioned him. Lol) he was awesome! Very attentive and made the experience that much better. 

We got a complimentary bruschetta for our table. Very tasty. We order the Ricotta  Spinach ravioli for an appetizer and it was fantastic. Dan had suggested the lamb, which my husband ordered, and I ordered the lasagna. Both were extremely good!! Portions were just right. For dessert we had the Creme Brûlée (I can never resist Creme Brûlée) and the Strawberry Cheesecake. Both amazing!!! 

By the time we got the bill, We were stunned how cheap the dinner was!! If we lived in NOLA, we would definitely come back on a regular basis!",4.0,2,1

"Went here tonight to pick up an online order. As my boyfriend gets out of his truck he reaches for his mask but it's not there and I forgot mine in my purse at home as well. An accident. We figure it will be in and out as we already purchased our meal. I am also in the food business, my manager tells us we are NOT to be the mask police. My boyfriend gets out and opens the door to the building. Before he even steps foot into the store KYNAN WATSON yells ""PUT A MASK ON ITS SO SIMPLE"" and tells him he has to get out!!! Shocked, my boyfriend asks to bring the order out to us then if they will not allow us without masks but yet not provide us with one. He stands outside looking into the building waiting and waiting. Kynan seems to disappear into the back and not seen again. MIND YOU our order said ready at 7:15 which is when we got there, and we didn't get it until about 7:45. No one inside would make eye contact with us as we stood out in 30 degree weather:( Time goes by and delivery drivers are coming in and out, he asks them to please look for his order. Multiple employees also encouraged us to complain and provided us with the name of the WORST MANAGER EVER. Awful service. 
Saw another review about this Kynan as well from 15 days ago. Step it up man!!!

Update!: we call the store to ask for a supervisor, owner, operator... someone we could call and complain to! The lovely Mr. Kynan speaks and says he is the highest up person we can talk to and wouldn't provide us with an email or number or name for anyone we could speak to. Also proceeds to say he does NOT remember the event at all. Wtf? At the end of the call he gives us the name of ""Phil"" and says good luck. Awful!",1.0,0,0
"Our first experience and probably our last. We arrived at 8:45. The host got our menus and was going to take us outside but someone stopped her and said ""we cut most of our servers there's going to be a 35-45 min wait""... almost the entire inside was open and 5 tables outside. So we decided to wait.. upon our re-arrival we got seated outside and waited 25 min before a server got our drinks. They walked around us like we didn't exist, we sat our menus off to the side and finally had to ask for someone. There was another table with the same issue and another table on which the manager let them know ""drinks are on us, we apology"".. The manager took focus on that table 

we then waited on our food, apps took about another 15 minutes just for Miso Soup, it was extremely salty and Luke warm (my guess is because they close soon) which I've never had it like this. We have been to Japan multiple times and eat sushi almost 3 times a month. Another 20 minutes later our next plate was the beef on the sizzling rocks, it was good. We then got our sushi after another 30 minutes as the staff was cleaning the windows and cleaning up. Then waited another 5 minutes because we requested Soy sauce which was not on our table. The Black Tuna and Dutch YellowTail Sashimi was wonderful and our rolls. I do wish it was a little colder (as it is all raw) as I felt like it was sitting out on our plate for a bit. 

Out of all the good things was how our server tried even though he had a bunch of tables. The manager was just walking around and they had one guy who's job was just to walk around with food and not help with anything else (he was more than capable of getting us more water). At the end we were hoping to get dessert but we're kind of rushed out so we just decided not even to ask since they didn't want to offer. 

Overall the food was pretty good, the service was absolutely terrible, the atmosphere was good. But we didn't plant to spend the rest of our evening waiting for a server then a longer wait for food and then soy sauce. I think for it being near ironworks and the location the management and owners would have a lot higher expectations...",2.0,0,0

"Excellent job by Accurate Roofing installing new roof and skylights. Thomas was extremely patient while explaining all the details and answering questions about this project. He provided various options of roof shingles, pointing out pros and cons of each system. That was indeed invaluable information for anyone who is not a roof expert. Price he gave was very competitive too.
We had very limited time for the installation since we wanted to do it before leaving for vacation. Despite these constraints and weather not being very cooperative in December, Thomas found a perfect day for the job and squeezed our project in the schedule. Not only that, he arranged for two of his crews to do the job and instead of two days, it took only one. 
After they finished, they cleaned the whole property from all the debris and using magnet took care of nails on the ground. Workmanship was perfect and we're very happy with the whole process. 
Even after project was completed and I had a question related to the small issue with skylight window, Thomas was quick to put me in touch with the appropriate support personnel. 
Thomas is extremely knowledgeable, reliable, efficient and honest professional. It was a pleasure to deal with him.

I was hesitant. I like the salon experience. Making the appointment, going in, having some coffee while chatting it up with someone at the desk, being taken to the back for a shampoo and scalp massage and then finally sitting in the chair for a new cut and style. 

Amber was awesome and is very good at her craft. She made suggestions for my thick straight hair and gave me a perfect cut. For $14 plus a tip, I walked away feeling fresh and sassy. She is very conversational, too, and seems to really enjoy what she does.",4.0,2,2

"Dear John - 

Italian food and John Besh are two of my favorite things in the world. So time and again I head off to Domenica (located in the Roosevelt Hotel) usually for happy hour. Which turns into dinner, cause I can't control myself.  Some of  my favorite pizzas EVER, but it doesn't stop there does it? Roasted Cauliflower with feta cheese dip, kale chips, desserts (including the ""bad pig cake"" that several of my Yelp friends ate not knowing the was hidden pork). That was OK, we all still giggle about it. Very elegant Italian entrees as well. Everything here is wonderful.

But I got to say, in the early days I thought you were affiliated with every restaurant under the ""Besh Umbrella."" And sadly these days I've figured out you really aren't. Do you mentor, advise and perhaps finance these people with a dream? Have they all worked for you? I think I've figured out that you're really only affiliated with your flagship Restaurant August and Luke, and I'm hoping you're going to be hands on in the new/improved Caribbean Room at the Ponchatrain Hotel. And the roof top bar. But you don't have anything under your ""Umbrella"" that isn't top notch, so I can get over it. I'm older and wiser now, and secure in our relationship.

Back to Domenica - happy hour every day with special prices on wine and beer and 1/2 pizza. The world's best pizza. But don't stop there, just keep going until you've tried it all. Cause it's so worth it. I always leave satisfied.

"After eight+ hours of dealing with surly library patrons, I just want to sit & stare for an hour or two. This process (I hear the humans call it, ""unwinding"") is best facilitated with an inexpensive, yet delicious, beer in one hand and a slice of pizza in the other. Mouth thus occupied, I don't have to talk to any of you assholes, not at all. I go here alone sometime between 5 and 7pm, sit at the downstairs bar, order a $2 pint or three, and get the fuck out before the ashtrays go down at 7pm. And hey, the pizza ain't THAT bad. The plain cheese slice is rather nice, actually (there, I said it).",4.0,2,2

"Called in an order and was able to pick it up in a few minutes.  The place is brand new and clean, and big -- the sign says they can seat 300 (I didn't go upstairs or downstairs to check it out) and the online menu says they seat 400 with 11 bathrooms and a gift shop!  My cheesesteak with sliced beef, provolone, grilled onions and hot peppers was tasty.  Very good but not not quite ""gourmet"".  It wasn't too dry and wasn't too wet. Where I was disappointed -- the fries were hot but underdone and therefore kind of greasy, and I, like most people, prefer them crispy and golden brown.  They were a little thicker and probably could have been amazing if they were cooked in peanut oil like you find at Five Guys or Boardwalk Fries (just a suggestion!).  While this place sounds like a cheesesteak and burger and hot dog place, the inner part looks like a Chinese restaurant with a big hot food buffet and a salad bar too!  I want them to be successful since they're new to this part of Old City, so I'll be back and hopefully the next time the fries will be better.  Reasonably priced and for now they have a 20% discount if you mention Yelp.  The phone number went to a voice mail, and seems to be forwarded to the owner's cell phone or something. A nice Asian woman quickly called me back (caller id showed a 609 number) but she was a little tough to understand.  She handed the phone to a guy who was quick with taking my order and answering my question or two.  So just a couple of minor items to fix and get to five stars!  Worth a try.",4.0,2,1

You either have to be there really early to get a seat or you need to be prepared to have your meal to-go. I would definitely come back otherwise!",4.0,2,2
"A great addition to the West end. This hidden gem is located in the new strip mall off Winterburn Road. The sourcing of local suppliers and the motto of minimizing the carbon footprint is admirable.

As mentioned in previous reviews, providing the mildly flavored water is a nice touch. The service is quick & friendly. The specials in addition to the regular menu provides a nice selection.

The food is fresh with a nice flavor. We tried the beef hot plate special which was enough for two to share. Ample beef along with the crispy & fresh veggies (side of plain rice) were very tasty. The chicken & Chinese sausage menu dish with rice was good but as good as the sizzling hot plate. The salad rolls & green onion cake were good starter.

Despite the Spartan furnishings and somewhat fast food feel of the restaurant it is definitely worth a repeat visit.

Due to the limited space take out is an option. They are still working on their liquor licence so non alcoholic beverages are the only option currently.

If you like fresh Asian fusion its worth a try. But if you are looking for an intimate dining experience  it may not meet your standards.",4.0,2,2

The syrup is sweet and the hot sauce hot.  The sides (e.g. greens, grits, corn bread, etc.) maybe aren't as authentic as in the south, but they were still pretty good.

I originally posted this review, very unhappy with my experience at this salon and how my nails turned out after my first time getting my nails done at Heights Beauty Lounge.

When I left the salon originally my nails had been cut off, and were uneven and different shapes and I left the salon that same evening  with beautifully done nails. They even added tips to give my nails the length back.

I live in the east bank and took the drive.  Mr. Joey was our server and I've never had a more attentive (not annoyingly so ) , quick, let you know options more and ways to keep the tab cheaper, was polite, and really was all around the perfect server. The manager Mr. Dewayne was also involved with the customers checking for satisfaction. The food was cooked perfectly. The steak was tender, the onion bloom was cooked just right. I wouldn't have changed anything. If you are wanting good service that you can TRUST.. come to this location.",5.0,2,1
"I've tried twice more since my initial review and I'm sad to say that it keeps going downhill. During my most recent visit, the service was just awful. Service of the small plates has always been sloppy. However we went in for brunch and found that we were lacking utensils and had to ask for everything twice. Better still, we were greeted by a surly teen who told us to Hold On when we walked in and actually rolled her eyes and snorted when we asked to sit in an open and widely available area of the restaurant. I can get much better service at a diner. 

The food ranged from lackluster to tragic. I was served a plate swimming in poach egg water and every single dish was under-seasoned. I will say that the coffee was outstanding.

At the end of the day this is an amateurish restaurant that is trying to be something that it simply is not.",1.0,0,0
"For almost 12 months i have been in contact with this company for a $300-400 hospital bill. Part of my claim was rejected because their travel insurance doesn't cover really any losses or costs (taxi, hotel, ticket modification etc) related to an illness during your trip (which would be the definition of a travel insurance), but they only cover medical expenses. 
But my hospital bill is still not refunded, I don't get real answers from their customer service, and i cannot even access my account anymore online to see progresses, documents, anything. 

Please asap advise when you refund the hospital bill (i have sent all requested documents moths ago)",1.0,0,0
"I've eaten at this place twice.  The first time I ordered a bowl of hot and sour soup, and Mandarin Kung Pao.  The Mandarin Kung Pao is listed under their ""signature dishes"", and their menu indicates that these dishes can be ordered with Beef, Chicken, Shrimp, or Vegetables and Tofu.  I asked if I could have a mixture of Chicken and Shrimp, and was told ""sure.""
 
The hot and sour soup was ho hum .  A generous portion, but not very exciting or very spicy.  The Mandarin Kung Pao with Chicken and Shrimp was outstanding.  It was so good that I went back two days later to order it again.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as good the second time.  Maybe 3 stars where the first time I had the dish was worthy of 4.5 stars.
 
There are a lot of cooks back there working in the open kitchen, which could account for the variability.  I will definitely try it again.",4.0,2,1
"Wow! Really good sushi!

Went here with my wife & Sis-in-law and we loved it! 

Food: We got plenty of rolls from Spicy Tuna to Dynamite Rolls, Crunch Shrimp Roll, Yum Yum roll, Philadelphia Roll and Mr. Kaiser roll and shared it all! Everything tasted fresh and clean. Becareful because you don't want to get too stuffed like I did haha! 

Inside: Very traditional setup inside, two areas for dining and the chefs are at the front so you can see them make the sushi. The bathroom is small but nice, guessing they took the Japanese traditional route there.

Service: Really A1 service! We were greeted nicely and the server was really respectful! We had two servers and both recommended great sushi.

"I finally made it to Topgolf!! It was so much fun. I went with a group of friends on a late Saturday night.  We got 2 bays because there were more than six of us. Most of us were newbies so we had to become members which is a onetime $5 fee. They also give you a membership card to make you feel like you belong to the fold! 

The associate that assisted us with set up was pretty knowledgeable and pleasant. She explained the point system and safety concerns pretty well. We also ordered a few appetizers. We ordered nachos and the chicken and lamb meatballs, which were pretty good. I'm looking forward to trying more items on their menu.

"Service is great, food is hit and miss. Wine is GREAT.

First, everyone has been very friendly in the 10-12 times I've dined here. There are a couple of seemingly inexperienced waitresses who don't come back to check on you if it's busy, but that's something that can happen anywhere. Overall, it's been great service and definitely friendly and a lot of smiles. 

Unfortunately, the food is hit and miss. The truffle fries are great, most of the salads are very tasty and seem quite fresh. The cheese plate has been outstanding (one time) and lackluster (a few times) with fridge-exposed cheese edges and also stale, almost soggy crackers from Trader Joes (we saw the package, maybe they were out of their regular crackers??) A friend got a burger that was not great on very hard bread. He couldn't actually chew the bread, it was that hard. 

The wine selection is great, a lot of central coast wines and the prices are really competitive (cheaper than Vons, about the same as TJ's for New Zealand whites, for example.) 

Bottom line: If you happen to order something they do well on that particular night, you'll likely have a great meal. Service is very friendly and warm and the wine is really good. Would not call this outstanding or very good for dinner or lunch, though, without a few tweaks in food quality.",3.0,1,2
"After buying nothing but Camry's outside of the St Louis area (great cars, very few repairs on our last 4 Camrys!!!), Weiss service is a disappointment. Went in for a standard oil change (synthetic so changed every 10,000mi). With 57k miles, wife was told we needed to change brake fluid. When asked to show me where in the Camry service schedule is says to replace brake fluid, then tech says he didn't know if Toyota has it in their manual. 
A day later, I called the service manager and expressed my concern that this ""selling"" services not sought by the customer AND not recommended by Toyota borders on unethical. He claimed that replacement of brake fluid was recommended by AAA (2 yr or 24k miles) which, as I researched, is not completely correct.) We will not be returning to Weiss for service.",1.0,0,0

"So much potential...

Let me start with some positives. The venue and atmosphere were great. Easy to get to, plenty of parking, and the food tastes pretty good. 

However Brother John's unfortunately has a bunch of drawbacks. 

First, the service. As other reviewers have noted, the service is bottom of the barrel. There were 3 groups queued up waiting to be seated and no host in sight. The restaurant was not busy at all and the wait staff was taking a very clear ""it's not my job"" approach to sitting down their customers. After getting sat I never once got my drink refilled in the 45 minutes we were there and my partner had to go up to the bar to get a beer because she wasn't present when the waitress came to get the initial order and never stopped back. 

Second issue, the portion sizes were comically small. For what this establishment is charging I expected (incorrectly) to walk away full. As an example the brisket was three very thinly sliced strips (think slices of bacon) for almost $12. On top of that they don't have any combo plates so you order everything separately which is was also unnecessary. Just offer a two or three meat combo plate. 

The overall cost given the portion size was also an issue. This is easily a $50 per head restaurant if you want to walk away satisfied. Which isn't an issue, but puts it in the top tier of BBQ Joints for cost. 

TLDR - good food, good atmosphere, laughable portion sizes, sky high costs, and poor service make Brother John's a 2 star experience",2.0,0,1

"Love this restaurant! I think the locals are snooty about it because it's in the same parking lot as a Walmart and a Dollar Tree, but this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in all Indy. I'd say it's #2 when it comes to food, but definitely #1 when it comes to the whole package of food, price, service, and ambiance. First, it's beautiful on the inside. Definitely worthy of a date night. There's a waterfall and koi fish inside when you first enter. The lighting is romantic and the atmosphere is VERY quiet. Kind of makes you feel self-conscious if you're dining alone. This is obviously meant as a sit-down, take-your-time restaurant, not the kind of place where you hurry in, smash some food in your mouth, and go.
Secondly, the service is  just so-so, but consider that there are very few staff and you might not mind the timing so much. They do get more courteous the more that you visit! I've been there about 6-7 times now and the service immediately went from ok to stellar from the 3rd visit up.
Next, the food choices are wide-ranging and there is always a special. I brought my vegan friends here and they really liked it, as well, but to be honest I've had better vegan food. Just keep in mind that fish by-products and broth go a LONG way to changing the flavors of the food, so meat-lovers and pescatarians, you will enjoy the food the way it was meant to be eaten! The hot and sour soup was DELICIOUS, just the proper amount of sour and a lot of well-developed flavor in the broth. The spring rolls, penang curried shrimp, and bak kut teh are authentic and delicious. The pad thai is amazing, as well. My unadventurous friend had the chicken with broccoli and really liked it. Dishes are $8-14 on average for dinner. The green tea ice cream was a good finisher.  If you order from here for takeout, they tend to be very fast and the portions are huge! Hope this place attracts more people because there's not many amazing Asian restaurants like this around Greenwood or even Indy. Like so many other reviewers, what first brought me here was the Groupon. I love a great deal, but trust me when I say it's worth every penny full price (mostly because it's not that expensive to begin with).",4.0,2,2

This place looks nice but the service is absolutely terrible. We came here not knowing any better. The waiter seated us and didn't even give us a menu.

"I am torn to rate this place. If I follow Yelp's criteria, it is 3 star or less. If I follow my heart, this place deserve 5 stars because it saves life. As a human that share 97% DNA with chimpanzees, I feel uneasy to give less. 

Sadness, as most previous reviews brought up, is unmistakably presented. It is a primate sanctuary. It is a sanctuary because some human acted inhumanly and irresponsibly that brought suffering upon the primates. One of the monkey gave us middle finger every time we called his name. The caretaker told us he was mistreated by his owner. The finger gestured speaks volume.

What I like about this sanctuary is the education purpose for young students. Mine are 6th to 8th grade so they understand more than their younger peers. We have a caretaker gave us presentation to each species and everyone listened tentatively. Cages are very closer to each other. Surprise, all primates live in harmonies. 

The sanctuary is so compacted that you can finish within 30 minutes. But you also learn a lot about primates without get distracted like you are in the zoo. Most of my students are ADHD. I was pleased they found calmness among visiting animals. We get chance to see great apes and monkeys from all over the world. Some are endangered. Students love great apes. Pagon, the Orangutan is their favorite. He is a magnificent gentle giant. Chimpanzees are on the naughty side. If they start throwing things to you, stay away, because the next subject fly towards you could be something from their bottom part.... You are forewarned. 

The sanctuary is a nonprofit foundation. The operation relied solely on donation and volunteer contributions. There are about 20+ monkeys retired from lab after 20+ years  of being the experiment subject for human disease treatment such as diabetes. They settled at the back side of the sanctuary. They are living in good life now. SPC has partnered with sanctuary and it is in process to set an education program for veteran training. Another good thing happened to these animals. 

Our students donated bunch of items that were listed on the sanctuary website. For return, they gain something mighty. It is their compassion to these less fortunate primates. That worth the 5 stars.",5.0,2,0
"After moving here from Vancouver, I was worried that I'll have to pay too much for fresh fish, maybe even never getting to taste that cold fatty flavour again. Long story short, I've been trying which ever restaurants with a high review here in Edmonton, only to taste disappointment (and bad tasting sashimi). Of course there are exceptions, and Sabu stands out on top of all the restaurants I've tried. Big portions for fair prices, fresh salmon sashimi (mmmm) and fast service. There's only a few people in here at the moment, but impression the chef gave me was impeccable. He was constantly looking over to make sure we get what we wanted. Friendly too.

"Really nice place! I've never eaten here or any of the other La Parrilla locations (had to check for both R's and both L's there for a moment). I'm kind of on one of those fashionable diet things being it's a new year, and I know I'm only setting myself up for disappointment because by February I'll be eating everything in sight. But for tonight, I went small and ordered a very simple, but delicious, bean and cheese burrito with some Spanish rice and lettuce, and a happy hour margarita. The bill was just $14 for all that and included endless chips, salsa and best of all: great service! Really good service. With a group of about 20+ co-workers, they seamlessly put us together and brought out everything we needed and I was impressed by how they worked well with a group. Some places seem to just fall apart when a group arrives, or when the group size expands throughout the course of a couple hours. But not here.

We even were treated to a mariachi performance that took requests and the sound was perfect- not too loud, so could still talk (though, it is nice to just listen). It took a while to process all the separate checks but that was mostly me since I was ready to go and do other stuff, but hey they had to sort through like 20 different bills, which must be a royal pain in the keester. Remember when we all used to pitch in a ton of cash and then figure it out when the change came back? Well, I'm 40 so most of you are probably too young to know what handling cash is like.
Anyhow, to sum up: Friendly staff, nice environment, hot fresh food, tasty margaritas and a perfect flan. The flan is out of this world, one of the best I've ever had, and based on my belly, you can surmise I've had a lot of flan. It's a perfect texture, not soft, but just perfect.. your fork carves in, scoops up a blueberry and whipped cream (hmmm) and it's just ambrosia and turns into impure thoughts of food lust. I'm quite impressed and I'll likely be back for more happy hour prices. I love happy hour, probably a bit too much, so maybe I'll walk or take Uber when I do, but that's just how I roll.",4.0,2,2

"Pleasantly surprised by Perch Pub.  I don't know why but I had it in my mind that this was not a place I ever wanted to go.  However, after a night at the ballet and wanting a quick drink and a bite to eat, Perch was an obvious, if not a simply convenient choice.  
We popped up and were greeted by a friendly hostess and subsequently a friendly bartender.  He could see it in our eyes that we wanted some drinks...STAT...and wasn't pushy about us ordering food but quickly got us menus when we said we were hungry.

"Visiting Philly and not turned on by cheesesteak, I decided to try their take on Cuban, a new favorite of mine after visiting Miami. I know it's a bad idea to try and find something like that in the north, but I needed a pick me up. The $5 mojitos at happy hour were nice, but I wished I had been approached by my waitress during my meal to order another. The $1 empanadas were very good, the beef was exactly what I would expect down in Miami. For my entree I ordered the Montuno de Lechon, pork shoulder, rice and beans, yucca, sweet corn tamale, avocado and plantains. The pork was sadly on the dry, tough side. Sweet Corn tamale was too sweet, there was def a sweetener added to this. Every thing else was done perfectly, even the yucca which I don't normally enjoy.  I wish it came with more plantains, or that their was an option to order them as a side, they were fantastic. I decided to end my meal with a cafe con leche.

"Pros: Finished product is great, knowledgeable salesman 
Cons: Installation process (details listed below)

We wanted to replace our floors so we shopped around and met David at Carpet Den. He was very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting us pick the flooring we wanted. We ultimately chose luxury vinyl plank flooring and set up installation. We were told the crew would start around 8am on a Tuesday morning. We held up our end of the bargain and completely prepared the house as instructed; we also set up a plumber to come pull all of our toilets and pedestal sink at 7:30am. 

The installation crew showed up at 11:30am so we sat for 4 hrs with no toilets. No apology nor explanation was given. The crew was now working from behind from the beginning.  Day 2, another contracted crew came in to finish the toerail/trim, but were delayed due to the original flooring crew being so far behind schedule. 
We were told the process would take two days so we had the plumber scheduled to come back at the end of the second day. He did, but could not reinstall our master bathroom toilet, again because the crew was so behind. They stayed until 8pm the second day and the late finish evidently prevented them from being able to clean up after themselves. There were nails, splinters, piles of planks, thick dust, drink bottles, small tools lying all around our house and driveway. We cleaned for over 3 hours after they left. Although we paid an additional several hundred dollars for them to install flooring in our furnished house and a separate charge to move appliances, they did not attempt to return the furniture to the correct place or even the correct room. They left the washer and dryer outside; they did not return them to the laundry room. We had to ask about the transition pieces, around the fireplace and the hallway/bathroom upstairs (we kept some carpet upstairs). It appears they were not going to place them; the head of the crew went out to the van to ""see what he had"" and informed us he did not have the correct color for the transition from bathroom to carpet upstairs. They did some slight damage to our bed, dragging it around and causing the supports to strip and some to come off (they left those laying in random places) and splintered some of the wood around the bed frame. 

We called and sent an email to David afterward explaining our concerns and frustrations that included several pictures. After a week, he and the owner/manager contacted us to rectify the issue.  I applaud their willingness to listen to what happened, and take ownership - even though it was a third party contractor that was the issue - and make it right.  
The finished product looks great and we are happy with our new floors.  David made a great flooring recommendation.",4.0,2,2

"WOW! Talk about CUSTOMER SERVICE!

I have had my hair cut here before, I'm a little particular about my hair and knew they would do a good job. I remember being very happy with my cut and service at that time, but it was a while ago.

Today I got to experience their waxing services. I had done some online research for the best brazilians in St. Louis, as I am thoroughly fed-up with the awful service I have received at European Wax Center, and Dominic Michael came up several times... specifically for a staff member named Amy. After so many glowing reviews, I called up and made an appointment specifically with her.

There is a reason why she is all the rave online - she MAKES this service. From start to finish, this was the most enjoyable (as enjoyable as a brazilian can be... ya hear me ladies?) experience I have had at a waxing appointment. The salon is gorgeous and conveniently located off of Ladue Road near the Ladue Schnucks.

The waxing room has warm lighting, pretty art on the walls and they play soothing music - you would ALMOST think you were about to get something a little more enjoyable, like a massage. I was led through the whole process and well informed on all of the materials they use. They have a product that is anti-microbial and anti-bacterial.

The session itself was quick but thorough and I'm definitely thrilled with the experience and my results. I will continue to utilize this location for both my hair and waxing needs. Yes, it is pricey - but talk about proof that you get what you pay for!",5.0,2,2

For our entrees, we had the ginger with chicken and drunken noodles and again, delicious (though the mango salad was definitely hard to top).

When it didn't turn out to be the bike for me, after a few rides, he offered me $75 for him to buy it back.   I asked him to take it on consignment instead, which he did, hoping to get a better price.   I didn't hear back from him, so I went to his shop to get the bike back for a guest for a few days.   It turns out that Tony had traded it for other bikes that he could repair and then sell.   He just didn't call me to come get the $75 that I was due from him.   Tony then offered to ""rent"" me a different bike for four days for $80, and then to call us ""even"" for my bike that he had traded without notifying me.   i was very disappointed in this entire transaction, and will not be going back to Tony's Bike Shop.",2.0,0,0

I was even able to add Oaxaca cheese on top.  I made a trip to Oaxaca, Mexico a few years ago and hadn't had Oaxaca cheese since.  It was great.

"Han Dynasty has been on my list to try for months. On a trip to Manayunk, when I spotted the newly soft-opened location on Main Street, I was stoked. I convinced my husband to try it with me with the phrase ""It's so hot on the Yelp boards."" That's all it took.

The waiter explained that the restaurant was family style which meant food came out when it was hot. Being a fairly hungry girl, I was thrilled that our food would come out more quickly with this system.

First out was the eggplant in garlic sauce which was rated at a ""3"" for heat, out of 10. The chinese eggplant was slathered in a spicy red sauce and served piping hot. The brown rice I requested was a bit on the crusty side. Perhaps it would have been better to go with the empty carbs and order the white. Next out was the bok choy with black mushrooms. I've never had mushrooms with such an amazingly chewy texture. The bok choy was cooked perfectly and the sauce was fairly mellow for both heat and heaviness. I would recommend both dishes.

A man who I'm pretty certain was the owner, Han, greeted us warmly and taught us some Chinese words on our way out of the restaurant. Because we were eating at such an odd hour, 3PM which is neither lunch nor dinner, we got to see the cooks come out and eat their meal as we were leaving. There was a lot of soup on their table, so I'm determined to try that out next time we go.",5.0,2,2
"I was driving from Florida to PA with my 3 year old son to get to my infant child who has been hospitalized since birth. 
He had a heart transplant in Florida and only CHOP is able to help my son. He's immunio suppressed. 
I called the hotel to make reservations, a man with a heavy Indian accent (not racist towards any ethnicity) I could BARELY understand him. I did ask him specifically if there were cockroaches in the hotel, he said no. He advised me to go book with hotels.com
I was transferred over to Wyndham garden in reservations DEPT and spoke with a 'Michael'. Another man with a heavy Indian accent who spelled my name wrong, got my email address wrong Never sent me a confirmation number. 
Tired and over whelmed as my child is extremely sick, we pull into the property. I see cockroaches around the doors. I did NOT bother to go to the lobby. 
*Note, I stayed in the Wyndham Garden hotel in Gainseville Florida, excellent people there. 

When I called him to tell him I would NOT be coming since I made my reservation on the contingency there were no cockroaches, his English magically became understandable. He told me I had made a 5 night reservation and since I didn't cancel within 24 hours he's keeping my $82 plus taxes. 
That's extremely insulting when I had made the reservation maybe 4 hours prior to check in. I was lied to about cockroaches. The place even smells disgusting when you walk by the doors. 
If you are a CHOP parent, it's better to sleep in the car than this place. Cockroaches have salmonella. The last thing you want to bring into your child's ICU room is germs and or bed bugs. 
*Note, I cannot say this place has bed bugs as once I saw the roaches outside, no way was I going to enter the lobby or check in to see if there were any bed bugs. 
I tried to reason with him and was met with yelling, multiple transfers to a call center. 

They never did send me an email for a confirmation because of course, 'Michael' from the main reservations line for Wyndham properties was more interested in selling me the third party services VS making the reservation. Upon calling back due to not having a reservation email, another woman from an Indian call center said my name was spelled wrong and they took the wrong email. The only thing the Wyndam reservation's line knows to do is take credit card numbers. 

I was then told to call another number in the morning, transferred yet again multiple times and originally told to 'wait for a specialist to 'find out what happened'. Reference # 4097267

Any parent with an extremely ill child should not have to wait a week for someone to contact you back especially when you're in an ICU with a complex sick child. This is a mountain of headache and siphons time from taking care of your child in an ICU. 
If they tell you they're going to investigate - it's stalling time so you do not have time to refute with your bank. 
It's simple, the hotel is not Wynham's standards. There is nothing to investigate. 

The hotel is littered with cockroaches, email a confirmation number of a refund. At least have integrity of embarrassment when someone doesn't show up to your lobby due to your filthy premises to issue a refund for a botched reservation made no less than 4 hours prior. 

In addition to that, I found myself having to search for yet another hotel in the middle of the night from a gas station parking lot which was another 40 minutes. Time which could had been spent sleeping to get to my sick child sooner in the morning.

I believe the front desk clerk should be fired but this is clearly how the manager permits this PARTICULAR Wyndham property to operate.",1.0,0,0

By far a horrible experience. After complaining about shrimp that we're not deveined in both the po'boy and the fried shrimp platter. We were told the practice was common in all but high end restaurants. The owner or manager did remove two of the five meals from the tab. Two of the other meals (crab cakes & fried fish) went uneaten except for the French fries which seemed frozen not fresh. The salad was a small plate of mostly wilted iceberg lettuce with two cucumber slices and a hint of carrot. The server then seemed put off that we complained at all. It was a $58.91 experience that we won't soon forget and hope that others won't repeat. I guess it's our mistake because we didn't check yelp before the experience and two waiters were fighting over which would get our table in a mostly empty restaurant just past 12:30.,1.0,0,0

"This place is ok. The funny thing I'm realizing is that I happened to agree with Matthew G's review completely and we both reviewed another place in Exton  which I agree 100% on his take there as well.

It's basically a little better version of Supercuts with beer. I got Danielle who is a speed demon. Thing that stinks is I bet she could be really good if she wasn't trying to bang out a haircut in 10 mins. As Matthew G said, the haircuts are ok without great attention and a couple uneven spots. I would seriously tip well over 60% of the bill at that place if I could get them to SLOW DOWN.

Last time we were there we had a coupon as well and they let us get the stuffed crust pizza then. It doesn't say on the coupon that it excludes certain pizzas. 

We get home and you can barely see any bacon on it, some pieces didn't even have any on it. The crust  was also kinda hard like it was stale. The pizza doesn't taste the same as it used to.

General Tso's chicken had a good flavor but the pieces were on the smaller side and slightly over-cooked (thus only four stars). Delicious egg rolls and crab rangoon.

The guy was awesome though. Give him a raise lol. Our waitress was also very friendly and kind so 5 stars for service (especially on a very busy brunch day).

The French toast was fluffy, sprinkled with powdered sugar, cinnamon, and just delicious! The corned beef hash was great though we would have liked a little more for a $4 side. The smoked salmon omelette had cream cheese and chives, and that was a nice taste combo. It reminded me a little of a bagel and lox that became an omelette. The western omelette was a nice basic can't-go-wrong classic with ham, cheese, peppers, and cheddar.

"We first connected with Bob Crist through a recommendation. Our master bath needed an upgraded shower (tearing out old tiles on walls and floor, building a seat, adding a safety bar, etc.) Bob came to assess the job and emailed the estimate the following day.

Two men arrived  promptly on the start date, but before work began they carefully laid drop cloths on the floors from the front door to the bathroom. It took 5 working days to complete the job. Every day the men arrived on time and cleaned up completely before they left. Unlike Bruce B.'s diatribe, we found John the tile man to be a complete professional whose work was METICULOUS. NO gaps, NO paper of any kind, and sharp, clean cuts. NOTHING was crooked.  The job was finished today and we couldn't be happier.

I had the veggie and shrimp tempura entree and my fiance had the all you can eat sushi option.

Rolls were 80% rice 20% content. In all my years eating sushi all over the country this place by far had the highest rice content ever. I will say however, with the small amount of ingredients in their rolls they are able to make and deliver them at a frantic pace. 

The tempura was ok. The tempura portion was small and it came with excess rice - 3 large scoops. The shrimp were ok but lacked a bit flavor-wise. The veggies were fine I just wish there was more tempura and less rice.

My boyfriend ordered the Fettuccine Pescatore which he said was to die for, extremely flavorful and delicious; I ordered the Free Range Chicken ""Pesto"" and it was one of the best plates of pasta I've ever had. The food was absolutely incredible. 

Our waitress, Tootie was extremely rude and judgmental, we were one of 3 tables seated in her section. She acted like anything we'd ask for (more water, bread, etc) was the biggest inconvenience of her life. Never once did she come over and ask how the food was or how we were doing. She ended up pawning us off onto her busser, who barely spoke English. He ended up giving us better service than she did! I had noticed that the customers seated in the table next to us were also celebrating a birthday, Tootie brought them out thee typical ""free birthday dessert"" and wished them a happy birthday (which wasn't even offered to us, surprise). Once we finished our dinner, we had planned on ordering dessert since it was my boyfriends birthday. We sat and waited, and waited, and waited for her to come over and even check on us. The busser ended up asking if we wanted to take a look at the dessert menu. 

We decided on the chocolate Cabernet glazed brownie, it was so fantastic. It was perfectly rich without being overwhelming. The ice cream was very good as well.

The bagel was also very delicious. I'm not sure if they make their bagels there or buy them from a local bakery, but they were fluffy and chewy, just how they should be.

"We stayed at this hotel for the New Year's Eve celebration and had a room with a beautiful view of the Ben Franklin Bridge and the fireworks display.  It was a wonderful show and my family and I were going to sleep when we began to smell someone lighting up a marijuana joint.   We called security and they sent someone up.  It was determined that the smell was possibly coming from the vents.  They said they'd check around.  They said they could not determine where it was coming from.   The smell then got worse and it was coming from the door that was adjoining the two rooms.  We called security again.  He then entered the room and also determined that the smell was coming from the next door room.   He knocked on the door and identified himself as security but no one would open the door.  They told us technically if they don't want to answer the door they don't have to.   Really?  This is a no smoking hotel and our room is full of smoke but you're going to allow it because they don't want to answer the door?   They said all they could do was charge them a cleaning fee.   Eventually the party subsided but why should others have to suffer because you have a policy and rules that you can't enforce?   We're not prudes and we're not against partying but when you're traveling with family (including children) the last thing you want to have to deal with is marijuana wafting into your room while you're trying to sleep.  

Management did eventually do a service recovery and that is why I did not give them a totally low score but there's no way other hotels would have allowed that to happen.

"I do believe that Paris Baguette has the most gorgeous pastries in Philadelphia. I'm surprised that they don't have a location closer to the city. I mean a trip to H Mart is very exciting for sure but Paris Baguette is the guilty pleasure that nobody can deny stopping in. 

Everything in the store is awesome looking, the golden brown puff pastries with a glaze that gleams. Things like Tiramisu choux puffs, peach cream Danishes, royal puddings, red bean mochi donut, tiramisu cakes that is shaped like a coffee cup, everything is inviting and begs you to take them home. 

So why would I only give it a 3 stars? Today, I floated into the store and browsing around in a dream-like trance. After trying hard to control myself and only selecting a few items, I come to a line in the register. When it's my turn the cashier seemed slightly irritated, an older Korean man went to ask him a question in Korean and he proceeded to raise his voice and said ""ENGLISH! I don't know what you want."" I was disturbed, he said it like the old man was at fault for not knowing the language. First of all, you're in a Korean supermarket where the majority of the clientele are Korean and you don't know the language. Second, how do you yell at the elderly like they are scum? They are at the very least your customer.

I must have shown my disgust on my face, because this is when he rudely called his colleague that speaks the language to see what the old man wants. When you go through all the pretty things in the store, it's a huge contrast to see the ugly attitude on display by a poorly trained, not give a damn staff.

Also, quite a few things run out before noon or else I would have bought them all.",3.0,1,2

"It's not easy but it is so worth it if you stick with it!

I can see clearly the low reviews were from those who didn't spend the time to inform themselves about what Bikrams is and what it is not. I used to train in Bikram Yoga daily for months at a time 15 years ago in Santa Barbara and it was exactly the same tonight as it was then: HOT, sweaty, detoxing, challenging, and ONLY BIKRAM YOGA NO OTHER YOGA IS TAUGHT. 

You get out of any workout or yoga what you put into it. It's regimented discipline is steeped in tried and true tradition and instructors have been trained that way and to say those exact things the same way for decades because it works. If you want cooler yoga and undisciplined style and want to hold your breath... then Bikram is not for you and that is ok.

I attended tonight's 6:30pm class after not doing Bikram for several years, although I do love to walk almost daily for 5 miles at a brisk pace, weather permitting. It was challenging and it was hot but I stuck through it. I feel amazing and doing 10 days in a row for 20 bucks as a welcome back offer...Many people in this culture straight off-the-couch may not be able to handle it at the level they'd like to be at and that is why they suggest if you need to lay down and rest that is ok, but please stay in the room! The half frozen aromatherapy towels for your face at the end was just epic and classy!

It also helps to drink plenty of clean water, not eat 2-3 hours before a class, and live a healthy lifestyle if you want to do something of this magnitude. That means eat well, rest well, don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, and stay away from wheat, sugar, and dairy products for a while if you may get fatigued or dizzy and a sign that you may be having hidden food sensitivities...just saying.",5.0,2,0

"Disappointing service & overpriced,mediocre food.

This being our first time in New Orleans we wanted to experience the much talked about Jazz brunch, which is how my husband and I ended up at Mr. B's....What a bad decision!

While the live jazz was good,nothing else at this place was even close to what is expected of a fine dining place....& we have eaten at many such places across the country. 

The service was sloppy at its best......& that is me being kind...we were seated next to a large party who were obviously ordering more food and lot more alcohol. To keep things smooth running at that table, the rest of the diners in the vicinity suffered. We had to wait a great while for someone to take our order, had to wave down the waiter for coffee refills, almost yell across the room to get a waiter's attention so that we could get some silverware for dessert, wait some more to get our check....WAIT was the keyword of this meal which made us feel discriminated against. 

The meal wasn't even worth a mention...my friend got the Eggs Benedict which average... I had an  egg white omelette with mushrooms and sausage that was salty and dripping in oil...I had a pool of it on my plate when the meal arrived. My entree came with some salad which was again drenched in oil dressing. The white chocolate brownie dessert was the saving grace, but because of our overall experience we didn't really enjoy that. 

I think the staff probably needs training on what a fine dining experience should be like for ALL diners regardless of the party size.

My recommendation: don't bother with this place.",2.0,0,0
"My husband and I drive past three Chinese restaurants to come to this China King. Their staples are yummy: Orange chicken, fried rice, lo mein...etc.  Ordered take out for lunch today and had the Hunan Beef with black bean sauce and Strawberry chicken. The lunches are $4.75 each and tons of food! They come with white or pork fried rice and an egg roll or soup.
The Strawberry chicken was pretty good, but I would totally order Orange, Sesame, or Sweet and Sour chicken over it.
The Hunan Beef with black beans, on the other hand, was no good.  Chewy, icky beef and the sauce...gross.  Just, eat here, but do not be adventurous like me and order this. But, I chose the Hot and Sour soup, and this was awesome! 
Crab rangoon is always a sure thing and quite delicious, especially if you like it on the sweeter side.

"While walking through the mall in Tampa; a coworker pointed out the eggplant in the window display which got our attention and made us want to check the store out. I had never been to LUSH before. Zach was amazing! Upon entering the store he greeted us immediately. He was so friendly and informative about all their products and the company. He was very encouraging about trying samples of different stuff. He was also honest about what products were good for certain skin types. He never made us feel pushed to buy anything.

I purchased a lotion bar and a massage bar. I haven't used the massage bar (saving for Vday with the hubby). But the lotion is amazing! My coworker purchased a few different things. 

If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Here is why...after leaving the store we went to shop at other places.  One coworker decided to sit on a bench and take a phone call. Fast forward about 30 minutes when my coworker came into the new store we were at I noticed her LUSH bag not in her hands. After looking for it we realized someone had stolen it. She immediately  called the store and they were happy to replace all of her items. TALK ABOUT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!",5.0,2,2
"Put down your phone, get yourself up outta your chair, and run to Dream Tacos! Not only was this the best taco I've ever had in my life (yes, including tacos I've eaten in Mexico), but it was one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth. Don't even think about ordering anything else until you've tried the Quesabirria first. When my dish came to the table, I picked up one of the super hot tacos, and almost dropped it because it was so heavy. Heavy with MEAT, people. That thing must have weighted 2 lbs. The outside was crazy crunchy fried cheese deliciousness, and don't even get me started on the slow cooked stewed meat....it's UNREAL.  The consumme on the side is a perfect compliment to the taco and definitely brings the flavor up a notch.  One word of warning:  the little cup of orange hot sauce they give you on the side is 5 Alarm.  If you like it hotttt, then use it, but don't say I didn't warn you.

I also should say that the service is great!  It's a family run joint, and they all pitch in.  It's clean and friendly, and I have nothing to else to say other than I wish I could give it 10 stars.",5.0,2,2

"Okay, so over the past two months I've become a regular lither.  At first I hated the lunges and squats at the barre, but now that I've been doing them awhile they are more manageable.  I really like the balance of cardio and sculpting in most classes.  I go to the 6 am classes and mostly the early classes on the weekends.  The wait list for 6 am moves pretty fast, but it's harder to get into evening classes last minute.  I would like to take more 7 am classes and then shower after and go to work, but I really don't love the locker room.  It's kind of tight when there's a bunch of people getting ready, and there really isn't much privacy.  I'm hoping that the new studio will fix that.
I pretty much like all of the instructors, some do more corrections than others.  My favorite classes are higher power, freestyle, barlesque, armistice, high mini, and hipster.  I love the juices and the food.  I frequently grab a smoothie for breakfast.  I do wish they could just connect your credit card that's on file with the purchases, instead of having to swipe a card every time.  It would go faster and they do that at other studios.  
I wouldn't say people are super friendly, but they also aren't intimidating.  Also, although there are some Barbie types, I think there is a nice mix of different body types among the instructors and the participants.  There's lots of modifications so everyone can get a great work out at their own level.",5.0,2,2

"If you're looking for an honest customer service driven Mercedes auto shop go to Stuggart Autohaus in there new location over in sparks. I know nothing about Mercedes maintenance since I just acquired one 6 months ago and I was nervous I would have to go to a dealership to get it serviced. After reading other reviews and getting a personal recommendation from a family member I decided to to go to Stuggart. This place is amazing. Everyone is super nice and they explain everything that they are doing. I thought I needed a transmission flush and he said he would check it to make sure so I am not wasting money on a service I might not need yet. Sure enough, turns out I'm good for another 15k before I need the tranny serviced. I asked them to check the cabin filters and he showed them to me and the definitely needed changed. The point is that they only do the necessary services and aren't in the biz to rip anyone off.

"We had an early evening reservation and were seated right away. The layout of the place hasn't changed much, but the decor definitely has. Lots of natural materials, including wood paneling, beams, and brick give it a very warm, rustic look with only framed mirrors as wall art. I also love that they added more booths.

Opening weekend never paints a true picture of a restaurant - service is usually either stellar or struggling to keep up. Mole y Abuela made sure their service was on the exceptional side and I hope it continues! From the warm welcome at the door until we left, the staff was very attentive. At a tapas restaurant, it's nice to have plates cleared quickly without having to ask in order to make room for more. 

* Drinks: The Pomegranate Caipirinha was beautiful with a black sugar rim and delicious floating pomegranate jewels. I tried the Vanilla Espresso Martini, but the expected marshmallow garnish was missing and the drink itself looked like it should've been creamy but it was almost straight vodka in strength and texture. 

Our table ordered & shared the following: 

*Papas Bravas - Cooked and seasoned well with yummy aioli.
*Jamon & Cheese Croquettes - outside was fried to perfection, but the inside texture was a little mushy. Heads up that the Chipotle cream sauce is definitely spicy.
*Bacon-wrapped Dates - SO GOOD! sweetness with crispy bacon.
*Eggs Diablo - these aren't mile-high with garnishes and the filling was very flavorful. I'm sure I'll always order these.
*Lamb & Pork Meatballs: Favorite menu item! Perfect doneness and accompanying yogurt mint sauce.
*Gambas al Ajillo - This didn't look shareable, so I just took a picture :)
*Cana de Cabra - Must try. Fig makes everything better.
*Chili chocolate cake: wonderful texture with warmth from the tajin and creamy gelato to balance it all. Excellent dessert item! 

They had run out of some items that were highly promoted on social media, so I'm ready to return and try more things. Great experience!",4.0,2,2

"One of my favorite places for wine tastings in Florida! You get eight one pours of eight of their selections for the month. This will cost you $7, for an additional $3 you get to take home a complimentary wine glass, see the pictures for what it looks like.

They also have what's called the Lux Selection which costs $12 or $15 for the complimentary glass and it includes one handcrafted chocolate selection from their bakery case.

"Two girlfriends and I went to Zahav, which is awesome because you feel cool just by being there. It feels like a place that cool people would hang out. We ordered the hummus and laffa, which found the rare balance between tahini, chickpeas, and olive oil; not greasy, not too creamy, not gritty. The theme of the night--everything was ""not"" too anything, it was all perfectly right.

The laffa was lightly peppered and hot out of the laffa-oven, and very pleasant to eat. Then Katie and Steph chose the chocolate semifreddo, which is a thick layer of mousse sitting on a crust, with candied kumquats spooned onto it. It resembles Cool Whip pie, and tastes like a Kinder bar with kumquats. The kumquats were the star- the citrus was so crisp it was like having a mouth full of Florida. Citrus and Kinder bars--of course! Of course!

I chose the Romanian; it seemed appropriate to replace the lamb shoulder with another meat dish. The Romanian is three chunks of hanger steak and three chunks of eggplant, with a big schmear of roasted red pepper chutney. The steak was so juicy that none of us wanted to chew it because we didn't want it to end, and the eggplant was very--eggplanty. I wish I could explain how it all tasted, but I don't know the words--juicy?--flavorful, I guess, and the most eggplant-y an eggplant can be, and the most steak-y a steak can be. How does it work? I don't know. Some of us use Excel and planners to achieve our potential, but apparently all an eggplant has to do is end its short vegetarian life at Zahav.",4.0,2,2

"I was excited to get a New Year's Eve dinner reservation at Le Citron after passing it quite often while driving down Tchoupitoulas. The other three people in my party arrived a few minutes before me and though they were immediately seated, the waiter insulted my friend's outfit when they were seated. When I arrived, there was no host to show me to my table (or even greet me), so I found it myself. It was a good thing the waiter was at the table when I arrived, otherwise I'm not sure how long it would have taken to get my water. It was clear to me immediately that he was not sober. 

Despite the limited menu and that there were only 3 other tables occupied in the restaurant, the service was very slow and the food was not good enough to make up for it. The waiter made awkward conversation each time he was at the table. Our waters were never refilled and one of my friends had to go to the bar to get another drink. If it wasn't for the bartender bringing our soups and entrees (the lone bright spot in this not so great experience), we might have celebrated the new year at our table. 

I don't think I'll be returning to Le Citron or recommending it to anyone looking for a nice place to eat.",2.0,0,1

We were not given small plates and had to track someone down. The fries were very good. My husband ordered an omelette. It came with a tiny order of potatoes and the omelette looked so small. Portions are just too small given the price point. They use high quality ingredients, but I don't think the price is justified. He walked out hungry.

"This visit to Salt was worthy of 5 stars...I was really wowed by the whole experience this time around.  For starters, we had the Kona Tacos, which are essentially tuna poke chunks served in a crispy wonton style shell with a spicy, sriracha-based sauce.  The tuna melted in my mouth!   For dinner, I picked the special fish of the day which was one I'd not heard of before but it was a mild whitefish that I chose to have finished with the scallop preparation (Spanish orzo in a saffron butter sauce)...it was amazing.  The fish was cooked to perfection and such a large filet that I couldn't finish it!   We had Brussels sprouts as our side, and my date had the seared yellowfin tuna ""au poivre""  which was equally well-prepared and delicious.

Went to Sisters & had great service, even though I have seen other reviews where the service was subpar, but then again there was only 2-3 other couples there with us. 

Soooo they had no choice but to pay attention to us. (Everyone does have a choice whether they want do something or not! )

"I echo the others below: if I could leave ABSOLUTELY ZERO STARS, I would do so. 

I rented a fairly expensive  home north of Swan/Sunrise for over 3 years, so you can imagine the monthly rent and exorbitant deposit I had to put down just to move into a house that was covered in cat hair and had knee-deep weeds in the back yard. It wasn't ""touch-up"" painted when I took occupancy, so I paid out of pocket to have that done.

I went through 4 property ""managers,"" each was more incompetent, undereducated, and and rude than the one before.  Multiple repair requests took many weeks & phonecalls to acknowledge, still other repair requests went ignored for over a year--even those that were safety-related.
When it came time to move out, I was nickel & dimed on everything, despite my meticulous cleaning and excellent care of the property for over 3 yrs. 
Expect them to try to withhold AT LEAST $500 of your deposit.

I think they are the lowest of the low, despite one of their owners stressing to me that they ""care about their tenants."" The only aspect of their tenants for which they have concern is their tenants' money: namely, keeping as much of it as possible. 
I  also plan to report them to the Better Business Bureau, and so too should you if you had as negative an experience with them as I have.

DO NOT RENT FROM THEM, NO MATTER HOW PERFECT THE PROPERTY APPEARS ON THE SURFACE. You will be raked over the coals at some time during your dealings with them.",1.0,0,0

"If you've just moved to Arizona and are looking for a new dentist and hoping to pop in for a simple teeth cleaning this is not the place for you. First after making an appointment specifically for cleaning and even after speaking to someone on the phone who made the appointment. 

Be ready for ""oh well you're a new patient so we can't do cleaning today that'll be a second appointment, you need x rays and a consultation first"" okay.. after filling out all the paperwork watch 2-3 other people go on ahead of you only to be told you must wait. 

Once you've done the x ray you get to wait more for the consultation. I requested a different appointment day this point because I had other things to do and wasn't prepared to spend the day doing this.

"I went with a few friends and we ordered several dishes to do family style. We each ordered one dish and a few sides to share, and had a bit leftover. The waitress and other servers seemed new but friendly. The food was amazing, but that's where anything good stopped. 

The ambiance was non-existent, and it looked like the only thing they had done in terms of decoration was add the sign out front. The lighting was terrible and cast a dingy glow over the dining room, and the food did indeed take over half an hour to arrive at our table. 

Overall, I would have said it was a good experience and they will catch on quickly as a new favorite in UCity since the food was good and the rest could be improved over time. However, they charged me TWICE for a $75 meal. I am not even sure how this happened, but it looks like they charged me once without the tip and then again with the tip. Over $150 for one evening. That's a pretty serious mistake to be making as a new restaurant. 

Looking forward to trying them again when they are more experienced with service and redecorated!",2.0,0,0

"The historic Pineville Tavern dating from 1742 is also one of the most enjoyable eating spots in the Delaware Valley (Greater Philadelphia).  In fact of all the many historic restaurants in the Philadelphia region, I think Pineville just might be my favorite.  Not only does it look great inside and out, it is such a chill place with one of the friendliest groups of servers of any place in Philly.  And it bends to the clientele.  On a recent visit, I sat in the lovely and charming outside patio area -  some folks were just sipping cocktails while others were having a full lunch.   Pineville accommodated both.
The food here is excellent which adds to its allure.  I started my lunch with a hearty and meaty bowl of Philly snapper soup (turtle  soup) - done totally right.  Add a little sherry to the soup and you will have one of the best soups you can find anywhere.  The main course was their famous housemade ravioli.  Boy is this tasty!  Indeed it is about the best ravioli I have eaten on this side of the Atlantic Ocean.  The sauce is just outstanding and you will eat every millimetre of it. My very friendly and competent waitress was named Sydney and I couldn't have had a better one.  Hey,  what's not to like about the old Pineville Tavern!",5.0,2,2

"I've lived here in New Orleans since Katrina. It's a city of culinary delights on par with New York and Paris. Restaurants here have to be good to compete and have success. 

One of our great seafood delights is char grilled oysters. I've tried them all over town, and the ones here are in a league of their own. Lots of tender loving care goes into all the prep work, and the actual grilling is an art form to behold.

They offer limited classes. So you may need to take those cycling and yoga classes somewhere else. The plan is to have more classes added.

"So I must admit, I've probably been to Zavino ten times since it opened.  The pizzas are excellent (and far better than Stella.)  I normally stick to the kennett, which is my favorite, and I think a general crowd pleaser.  Tonight, I sampled their new spring pizza which was a lamb sausage with a pesto.  It was great, not as great as the Kennett, but very enjoyable.  The antipasti plate is fabulous - and brimming with meat and cheese.  While not on the menu regularly, I've had the ricotta as a special, which is also not to be missed.  The wine list is very affordable.  They have an excellent malbec that is only 6.00 a glass.

Its a great place.  I recommend going early or on the late end because it tends to get very packed, and is very tiny.",5.0,2,2
"Overall Value: It's a cool space and I enjoyed trying the homemade brews, but the food was just meh and kinda overpriced.  It's fine to stop here for a beer or two, but I would probably go elsewhere for dinner.

The Food/Drinks: We got the fried chicken sandwich ($16) which came with fries, the brisket sliders ($12), and 16oz drafts of the Hasselhoff Helles and Always Sunny from their seasonal brews ($6.50 each).  Both dishes were pretty disappointing.  The Fried chicken sandwich was dry and pretty lackluster in flavor.  It's thin and larger than the bun, kind of like a schnitzel, but really just not fried that well.  The fries that came with it were by far the best thing we ate.  There is a fried pickle that is added to the top of the sandwich as a decoration, which looks odd but adds at least a little flavor to the otherwise nondescript chicken.  My complaints with were similar - the meat was dry and even though it looked like there was some fried onions and other assortments added to the sliders, the overall flavor was just meh.  To top it off, the buns for their sandwiches are a little on the stale end for my tastes.  I would probably just get a side of fries if I came back and leave it at that.  

The beers were good and they had a nice selection.  

Service:  There is a downstairs seating area with table service, and an upstairs bar with extra communal seating where you can order directly from the bartender.  The upstairs was not too busy, so we opted for that.  The bartender struggled a bit keeping up with orders, so we did have to wait 5-ish minutes at the bar every time someone in the group wanted to place an order or close out the tab.  Although I like the look of the upstairs, I would probably recommend just being seated in the downstairs area if you plan on ordering food.  It was just too clunky.  

Space and pace:  I really do like the look of the brewery (I am a sucker for any industrial look) and it is a big space, making it good for groups.  It had a decent number of people in the restaurant without being too busy or packed on a saturday night.  I think it's a good place to include on a bar hop, but I probably wouldn't make it the focus of your outing.",3.0,1,1
"I decided to try a new place for a manicure and pedicure in Chester county.   It was a welcome surprise from the moment you walk in the door it is so relaxing with friendly staff at the front desk.   I made an after work appointment the day before.  It is open until 7.  The salon is beautifully decorated with tranquil colors of white and turquoise color scheme.  The pillows have ""happy place"" on them.  I had to wait a few extra minutes before my pedicure.   It was not an issue as I was directed to start soaking my feet for my pedicure.   The seats are comfortable although they do not recline you can remove the pillow and it has a remote for massaging.   My pedicure with thorough and relaxing.   The other nice feature of the salon is the fact manicures are done at the manicure bar.  Beverages are served and if you are a wine drinker, red or white wine.  Another highlight is the kid's menu for kids under 12.  I know my daughter will love it.   My preference is to return during the week or after work.  Other features free wi-fi and fume-free.  The prices are pretty standard to other salons.",5.0,2,1

"Upon move out I have to update my review of Azure. I lived here for 2 years and things were great at the beginning but unfortunately it became apparent money was more important than keeping a resident happy. 

When it came time to renew, my rent went up as is expected but they would not honor my garage discount. I rented 2 garages so I was paying full price for 1 and a discount for the 2nd. They said if I renew my lease I have to start paying full price for both. I asked if a manager would honor the old price and it was looked into but ultimately they decided no. That's fine and all but after only a few months an email was sent out to all residents offering all garages for a discount. This tells me they could have given me a discount but wanted as much money as they could get. 

During my 2nd year they decided to create ""visitor only parking"". This didn't affect me since I had a garage but made it impossible for me to have guests as most of the spots were taken every evening. I was not allowed to have my guests park behind my garage either because they didn't have a sticker and would be towed. I know if you don't have a garage parking is horrible because I heard many residents complain that the visitor spots took away from the resident parking. Azure would send out reminder emails saying residents can't park in visitor parking and suggested residents rent a garage for guaranteed parking. 

Due to the horrible parking situation, many residents and their visitors decided to start parking behind my garage which would block me in or keep me out. This caused me to be late to work since i had to wait for the tow company to move them to let me out (the tow company took over an hour to come) or I'd have to roam around looking for a place to park. Azure's solution was put a sign up saying not to park behind my garage. I was never reimbursed for my troubles or offered any other compensation. Keep in mind I'm paying for 2 garages at full price  even though they were giving discounts to new rentals. I was dealing with the problem at least twice a week since their own maintenance employees, trash collectors, and delivery drivers would also park behind my garage. 

At one point they needed to seal the asphalt for the whole complex resulting in closing off half at a time so I was unable to use my garages at all and was required to park in an open field and take a shuttle to the complex since there wasn't enough parking for everyone. I've never lived in an apartment that does this but if I'm assuming it will be done again with similar difficulties for the residents. 

Now, I could deal with the parking problems but the final issue that created a 1 star rating is when I moved out. I have lived in apartments throughout Florida for 11 years. I always clean everything but of course it's going to look like someone lived there. After moving out I received a $600 bill to replace the carpet and stovetop. I have never been billed from a previous apartment for replacing or cleaning anything. I used the stove daily for 2 years, for them to expect it to be spotless is absurd and to charge me $500 to replace it was excessive as the stove functioned perfectly. Oh and I moved out early since I found a house to buy so I already had to pay over $3000 in extra move out fees and the $600 was on top of that. 

Also, you are stuck with Spectrum for internet. They obviously have some sort of contract with them so no other company can come in. I paid $60 a month for the slowest speed. Now with my house I have options and use Frontier, paying $30 a month for the fastest internet. 

Overall, I was paying $1619 for a 2/2 plus $320 for the 2 garages when I renewed last May. I paid over $3000 to move out early in February. I chose to buy a house because I saved money having a mortgage for a 4 bed/2 bath home. I feel like if they needed to replace anything they should have contacted me first to discuss, not just send a bill after the fact. Or maybe even use some of the over $20,000 they made in 10 months from me after my renewal (not counting the money they made the year before). Due to these issues I can no longer recommend Azure to anyone.",1.0,0,0
"I love coming down here in the area for many reasons, this being one of them. Great finds, local flavors, unexpected eye opening experiences. All of this  brought together with owners treating you like family that they haven't seen in decades. You will not find a feeling like this at a big business type establishments. Taco Loco with that family inside working together  offers you a home like feel with a traditional style dish.

If you guys drive by here and feel standoffish because you hear a generator humming away, then you missed out . Taco Loco is a solid , guarantee to satisfy you with out breaking the bank.  

Ordered 3 tacos choriqueso (chorizo and cheese) carnita (pork) and a pollo (chicken) soft shell taco. All 3 were filled , heavy, meaning they are not being selfish with the meat and simply delicious . The Carnita (pork) was tender, full of spices with a flavorful rush to the senses. It literally melted in my mouth with every bite, a must order. The chicken taco another great tasting option. If you like chorizo with cheese these guys nailed it. Great tasting chorizo, a nice spicy sausage chopped and layered perfectly with the cheese holding everything in place. A blanket of deliciousness with a fresh warm tortilla enhancing this to a whole different level. All 3 for a grand total of $6.50, yes I did type that correctly without any errors.  

Where else can you find fresh ingredients, fresh salsas with different measures of heat? Where else can you find a truck that offers homemade traditional Mexican food with a price that can not be matched? Taco Loco with everything you have to offer you guys will be around for a while.

"I found out about this place through my girlfriend, as she (not so subtly) hinted to me that she had picked up peonies (her favorite) from this store once before, and loved them.  So a few weeks ago, in planning for VD, I called and spoke with Grace about ordering some peonies.  She was not only helpful, friendly, and informative - she was able to order the flowers and have them ready for me by VD.

I picked the flowers up yesterday and the order was exactly what Grace and I had discussed over the phone, for the price we had discussed.  The flowers were arranged fantastically, and Grace took extra care to wrap the flowers, box the flowers, and put caps with water on the flowers so they stayed fresh during the delivery.  Grace even kept the store open past normal hours to allow me time to get over there and pick them up.

Per my girlfriend (as I don't know much about flowers..), the peonies were the best she's ever seen, with a great color and just on the verge of opening up, meaning they would last a long time.  The arrangement was a little more expensive than you would pay at an average store.  That being said, the flowers were special ordered, perfect, and the customer service was outstanding - well, well worth the price.

"I stopped into this newly opened women's clothing store on my lunch break. It is still in the soft opening, with the grand opening scheduled on 9/21/19.
I love that there is finally this kind of shop in the northwest area. I feel like Northwest Reno is lacking in locally owned retail shops. 
The selection is really good. Ranging from work out to formal and everything in between. Pricing is right on the money... very reasonable!
The shop is small but not overcrowded, so you can comfortably walk around and not feel squished. 
I really like that I the shop does not have that odd smell of used clothing that I typically smell at the ""other"" used clothing stores.
Staff is super friendly, and genuinely happy to help you find what you're looking for, or to just let you roam.
They do buy items as well, though I did not go through this process. More on that later, when I do.
I will definitely be back often to check out the new additions!",5.0,2,2

"I wanted to give a shout-out to The Boise Farmers Market for their innovative drive-through pick up system they implemented during the stay-at-home requirements.  Tuesday mornings, starting at 7:00 am, you can reserve a time to pick up fresh, local veggies, meat, seafood, poultry, cheese, herbs, plants, well you get the idea, without having to compromise the safety of yourself, the vendors, and volunteers.  Once you get your time slot, peruse their extensive online offerings, fill up a basket, and check out.  Then on Saturday at your allotted time, show up at the market on Shoreline Drive, open your trunk, they'll pop in your goodies, and you're on your way.  They also have special pick-up locations for those who want to walk or bike to pick up orders. 
If you want a time slot, make sure to sign up early on Tuesday because they go fast, but if you miss out, there's always next week.",5.0,2,2
"This place is a Florida classic! It's got fresh seafood  of every type and specials EVERY day of the week. Don't be fooled by the tiny cottage on the front because this place is huge inside! There are tiny private rooms with lots of kitsch inside, a tiki bar in the back and huge covered seating out of the sun in the back as well. I bike ride here since it's just off the Pinellas trail. They have $1 sushi Monday and the best fish & chips ever! Service was excellent. Prices are great and the dishes are huge and perfect for sharing if you want to save some money and not put on the pounds! Go. You will not be unhappy.",5.0,2,2

"Where do I begin? I went in for routine maintenance on my FJ Cruiser, oil change, tire rotation, etc..  When I came to get the car, after hours, I found a filter laying inside the car, glove box open, filthy inside from greasy hands and dirty shoes. I threw out the filter, thinking it was something they were supposed to replace and, turns out it was the tray that holds the AC filter!  I discovered this at my next maintenance check. I had an expensive iPhone holder/charger accessory that was missing too. When I called the service manager the next day he said that no one saw my iPhone accessory laying around.  What?!? How about holding the technicians that worked on the car responsible?! I tried to get them to pay for the new one but was so aggravated by the lack of giving a shit I decided it wasn't worth the aggravation. I am having my car serviced by another company now and they pointed out the missing tray and filter. Thank you Ray Brant Toyota,I had just gotten over the rest of your poor service and your technicians stealing from me. 

I only brought my car there because it is close to the airport and I thought it would be great to be able to leave it there to have the work done while I was out of town. Don't do it!  They are incompetent and really don't give a shit.",1.0,0,0
"This is, without question, the worst McDonald's I've ever experienced. 

There is no management at all at this location.  

I live down the street from this place and I go here A LOT for breakfast.  I love the egg mcmuffin and now the egg white delight.  Unfortunately, this location is my only McDonald's choice as no other location is close or convenient.   McDonald's competitors don't have a hot bfast sandwich comparable in calories or fat.   

On weekday mornings the drive normally functions reasonably well.  Getting the actual food you ordered is another matter.  I just make it a habit at the pickup window to tell them what I ordered (they never ask) in hopes of getting it correct.  I've stopped ordering the oatmeal because they over fill it with hot water and you just get soup.  The last time I went inside to see the manager and explain the problem and that it had happened 3 times in a row.  She had no interest in fixing the problem -- she just made me another being careful to do it correctly. 

Never go through the drive up at this location on weekends.  I just got back.  At 4 in the afternoon with just 2 cars ahead of me to order, I was in line 20 minutes.  From the time stamp on my receipt of my order time until the time I actually picked up my double cheeseburger was 12 mins.  And they weren't busy.   There is simply no management.  

On a Sunday last year, from the time I paid until the time I got to the pickup window (only 2 cars ahead of me) nearly 20 mins had passed.  When I got to the pickup window they told me they were no longer serving breakfast!!!!!!!!!!!   I tried complaining to the manager but she told me it wasn't her fault because no one there listened to her.   

I've complained to corporate McDonald's but they seem completely uninterested in providing a positive customer experience at an inner city location.  

It's really sad that such an iconic brand that was once legendary for service has willingly become so terrible.",1.0,0,0

"While I have been sick, I have been crazing Chinese food. Seriously craving. Eating it twice a day. It's total comfort food for me. I love me shrimp fried rice with a little sweet and sour sauce. Soooooo good. 

It being a Sunday, my favorite place was closed. So I drove down Oracle and found ""Panda One."" Strangely enough it's the same location where my favorite Chinese food take-out place once stood, Tokyo Rice Bowl. As it is, Panda One is something different.
It's fairly generic inside and not particularly anything distinguishing about the decor or menu. I can't vouch for any lunch specials and all I had was a large shrimp fried rice to go. It was made up pretty quick and cost under $7.00. 

It wasn't the best shrimp fried rice- there was quite a few pieces of large shrimp but it did not grab me. I would consider going back again if I find a coupon or a good deal, but otherwise there seem to be other places in town I'd rather gravitate toward!",3.0,1,1

"It's hard for me to say anything negative about this theatre.  I embarked on a road trip from Chicagoland all the way down to New Orleans just for a show (sure, I made the best of the weekend and stayed a few days).

The theatre is beautiful on the inside.  It is stylized with ornate art deco architecture, definitely a bit of a step back in time.  The queue to get in went surprisingly fast, though with the entire venue being assigned seating there was no rush anyway.

What I really liked about this venue is how the seating is arranged.  Not only is it on a slight decline towards the stage (so it becomes easier for all to see) the seats are also dispersed in such a way that view of the row in front of you will be between seats as opposed to the back of someone's head.  Even with tall people, you'll still be able to see much of the stage (assuming you aren't Billy Barty).

I did come for the NIN show so surely they had their best sound techs on the job, but the acoustics are great and sounded better than most shows I've been to.",5.0,2,2
"Very satisfied.  I got there early on a Sunday, about 5 minutes before they opened.  They were able to fix my bent rim and have me driving in 20 minutes.  Plus it was only $15.

Their card machine was broken this day, but the manager was ok with me leaving to go to an ATM and come back.  Bilingual staff.  I highly recommend this shop and will go back to them in the future.

Estoy muy contento con el servicio que recibí.  Llegué en un domingo unos cinco minutos antes de que se abrió.  Se fijaron mi rine en veinte minutos.  Solo $15.

"Browsing Yelp for a good place to get lunch earlier today and I'm really glad I found Wayfare. It's a new place, but they really know what they're doing. I got my sandwich to go, but I'm definitely gonna come back with friends to try out the rest of the menu. 

I got the Fennel Sausage and Egg sandwich. It was delicious! The sausage had great texture (tender, but still had a good bite to it), and the peppers on the sandwich had the perfect amount of heat. The chips were thin and crispy, but they could use a bit more seasoning/salt. They didn't seem to have any when I ate them, but otherwise were really good. The bread could have been a bit more toasted, but I'm guessing it was because I had it to go, so I didn't get it when it was fresh from the kitchen.

It was a bit on the pricy side, but the ingredients were super nice quality, and I enjoyed it overall, so wasn't too bad. It came out to be about $13, and I left a small tip when I picked it up. Definitely filled me up, but again, it's not something that I think I could afford to eat regularly.",4.0,2,2

"Hosted a birthday party at their Banquet Hall, and I have to say it was a very pleasant experience.  

The main think I liked and which is very important in any party is the quality of the food and I would give them a A+ since it was fresh and hot.  Especially the appetizers were great as all my guests loved it since it was hot and freshly made.   I didn't have to check on the dishes running out or anything as they got filled in as and when they got down to a certain limit.  The last thing you want is to spending time asking for the dishes in midst of a party, so that deserves a A+ too.  To top all of this the environment was clean and neat.  Had a separate entrance to our party room so that the guests don't have to go through the restaurant, which I think adds a nice experience to the guests.

Special kudos to Manager Shankar who was very flexible and understanding to our requirements and our hostess Jothi who was also very good and attentive to our requests.  Very fast in removing the used plates and checking up to make sure everything is ok.   They set the expectations and constraints(if any) right at the outset so that you can plan for the party accordingly and this also makes sure that there are no surprises during the party.

Would reccommend to anyone planning to host a party.

"First class business and first class employees.  I called three times to seek help with choosing the right knife  (since I know nothing about knives) and how to care for it.  Some people say there is no such thing as asking a dumb question--well let me tell you, there is, and I asked a lot of them.  However, all three of the staff members I spoke with were professional, thorough, and friendly throughout the whole process and took plenty of time to answer all of my questions!  I left my conversation with knowledge on everything I inquired about and then some. On top of my several questions, when I purchased the knife, I blew it and noted the incorrect shipping address. The staff member was very helpful when I called to report my mistake--she corrected it immediately and less than two hours later, they had shipped the item and included a tracking number for me.  Point is, I probably drove them nuts but I was met with nothing but kindness, patience, thorough responses, and professionalism.

"So...I had always thought this place was a hipstrix hangout, and finally I go in to get a BLT and a coffee only to find out that it's just a big gay sunbeam of lesbianist and transgender pride.  Don't make the same mistake; The odds are less in your favor.  There's really nothing more to it.  Sure, you may think it's cool to show your gay-friendliness, but isn't this bandwagon just as passe as letting everyone know you drink PBR? I used to think it would be a good place to people watch at the corner of Arsenal and Grand, but I found it all too much of a distraction.

Such an exceptional job for a great price. It's no frills but efficient and my Daisy is happy! I love how they give her a cute bandanna every time.

"I found Brick Oven Pizza entirely by accident as it is located in the only small strip mall on Trininty Rd. Let's all agree there is no single ""Best"" pizza for every single person's taste in the universe, but let me tell you why I rate their pizza in the top! For cheese pizza I would recommend you request they cook the pizza just a little bit longer just so the edge of the crust gets crispy. Not to say one not cooked in this manner is bad, but to me the little bit of extra crispiness takes the great pizza and makes it fantastic!!! I would also recommend you try the white pizza with spinach. I once jokingly said you can always tell how good the regular pizza is by ordering their white pizza....and I kinda-sorta have started believing it. Their white pizza has just the right amount of garlic and their spinach is delicious. I can also tell their grated parmesan is of high quality. Once I wasn't hungry enough for pizza and ordered a caesar salad and it was the freshest salad I think I had ever had anywhere. I'm not one to rave about salads, but I was more than surprised at how fresh and flavorful it was. I have also had the manicotti and lasagne and again was astounded at how flavorful they were. I've had these items elsewhere and they have always seemed ""flat"" with nothing to rave about. At Brick Oven Pizza they are delicious. One last item I ventured upon as I rarely have dessert, is their tiramisu. They will readily admit they do not make it, but it must come from tiramisu-heaven. I found that I liked tiramisu about 3 years ago, and now will get it as a dessert item when available. I'll try any brand. Whether from a bakery or Publix or Winn Dixie or where ever. There is something about theirs which is a sensory delight. It seems the bottom layer of the tiramisu has just enough liquid flavoring. I don't know if it rum or coffee flavoring or a combination or maybe something else completely. I know it lands at the top of my favorites. As far as drinks, they have a selection of good beers and wines. I like that their soda dispenser is located so I can mix my lemonade + seltzer myself. Staff is always courteous. Owners are usually in attendance. Very reasonably priced. Five stars!",5.0,2,2

"Great place to have a casual meal, especially when the weather is nice. 

Amuni is now Uncle Giuseppe.   They have a deli and premade foods in addition to the pizza. They also have some seating, both inside and outside. You order at the at the deli counter or the cashier (for pizza), then they bring you the food when it is ready.

They do not sell alcohol, but there is a wine bar next door where you can buy a bottle to drink at Amuni. Or you can bring your own bottle. Note: Amuni has a corkscrew but no wine glasses. If you dont want to drink out of plastic cups, you need to buy wine from the wine bar. 

The pizza is excellent. I highly recommend pizzas with Stracciatella instead of mozzarella, although both are good. The Stracciatella is so mild and creamy.  The crust is perfect, worth eating rather than discarding. It is crispy on the outside, with a nice chew.",5.0,2,2
"Wanted to get some ice cream w/ my girlfriend after Easter Sunday. Went to one place. It was closed. Drove by here on the way to another, decided to stop because it looked interesting.

Right next to a BBQ place, Jeremiah's has an interesting design, to say the least. Order your stuff at the window, then sit in the garage-style dining area to enjoy your frozen delight. A nice touch in FL, as you get to enjoy nice weather or be sheltered from bad weather.

At Jeremiah's, you have the choice of 3 kinds of treats. They offer soft-serve ice cream (only 3 flavors, Vanilla, Chocolate, and Swirl), a rotating selection of Italian Ice, and the option to get a ""gelati"", which is soft serve and Italian Ice layered together.

The Italian Ice here is what makes it stand out, as any place can offer soft serve (though Jeremiah's does great with this too). Unlike grainy, unflavored Italian Ice you might have had in the past, Jeremiah's is soft, almost creamy (though with enough grain to let you know you have something different), and flavorful. Make sure you get a gelati, it's really just the perfect thing for a hot Sunday after church.",5.0,2,2
"This time my friend C and I went to dinner for the real deal. We agreed on ordering different big honking pieces of meat, but didn't want to go overboard on anything else, so we started with the oysters (6 for $18 - 3 from the east coast, 3 from the west coast).  All was good, until my friend found a long curly hair on her plate (not ON the food, but on the plate).  Staff promptly apologized and later gifted us with 2 different steak sauces (valued at $8 total), plus cookies and dessert. We were pleased with the resolution.

They provided a gorgeous supply of artisan bread and fahncy butter.  I fell in love with sourdough baguette bread and they happily brought more upon request.

C went for the $45 filet. She likes her meat rare and bloody and I kinda think she's a vampire but she loved hers.

I went for the $49 rib eye. Call me a heathen, but I like my steak as close to well done as possible without really being well done, so medium well?  I loved the crispity charred meat bark on the outside, and the inside was still very tender and juicy. They got my request done to perfection.  

I couldn't finish my rib eye, so they bagged my leftovers well.

"Omoni is a gem tucked away in Carmel.  I will admit... the first time going in, ordering was a little intimidating.  The restaurant is setup with counter-style ordering, with fresh veggies added directly to your dishes.  I would definitely ask the staff for help ordering if you don't what you would like... they are always very helpful and guide you into something tasty.

I've tried quite a few dishes on the menu... some of my favorites are: 1) Beef Dolsot Bibimbap, 2) Vegetarian Chap Chae Noodles and 3) Chicken Bibimbap.

The Dolsot bowls are really something unique and you can only get them if you dine in.  Essentially, they put your bibimbap (rice, meat, veggie) into a stone bowl and heat it up.  It results with the rice deliciously crisping up and the veggies starting to cook.  Don't make a rookie mistake and eat it too soon though... it comes out scalding hot.  You've been warned.

The service at Omoni is always solid - good people that care about their work.  Overall, the ambience is very nice... the dining room is clean and simple.",4.0,2,2

"The white mushroom pizza is delicious. I like to add chicken on mine for some protein, but it's just as good without. The crust is thin and crispy, unlike the doughy, soft type from large delivery chains. the crust to topping ratio is good, not too much cheese nor too little. It's the perfect combination of crisp and chew. The atmosphere is modern, but casual, and the staff are very friendly.

"My family and I came here for breakfast around 5:30am after dropping my daughter at the airport. We decided we wanted to come here because it's not too out of the way for us from the airport to come. I've only been to Melrose Diner couple of times in the past and I enjoyed it. I remember older female waitresses serving us in a typical South Philly way (upfront, but not rude, almost like you're at your aunt's house or something). Unfortunately, my experience today was so different. There were handful of customers already eating or waiting for their food. A youngish guy was manning the cash register, upon seeing us he just points towards the seating area, I took that as just pick seats and sit. Then a non smiling male waiter comes and gives us the menu. I tried to be understanding because it's 5:30am and maybe they have been working the graveyard shift. We ordered our food and waited. After 5 minutes or so our waiter comes back and asks us what we ordered 
Then, apparently a regular customer comes in and he must be an important guy. These waiters put coffee on the counter before this important man even gets to the counter. And guess what? These waiters miraculously become attentive to the customers and our waiter even smiled when he came back with our food. Wow... 

Anyway, food is okay. I remembered the food to be better, but maybe that was my little chickling days. I have tasted better diner food elsewhere. The only good thing going is the on-site parking, because this is South Philly after all and parking is difficult to find. Other than that, I will go to other diners. Maybe if I came here during lunch time or dinner time it'll be different, but my breakfast experience was very disappointing.",2.0,0,0

"This place sucks and so does Pat's. It's a shame that some people choose to have their first cheesesteak at one of these two places. They're really overpriced, their cheesesteak options are very limited, and they are pretty rude if you take more than 5 seconds to order. They literally move you along like an assembly line. There's a million other places to get a cheesesteak in Philly and 99% of them are better. Most places also give you more/ better quality meat and way more of a variety like chicken, different cheeses (not everybody likes cheese wiz and provolone), and endless toppings (onions, cheese, and a pepper is all you'll get at Geno's). And it's the same with their fries. In my opinion, the only difference between these two places is the bread. Worst of all, there's no inside. So finding a place to eat outside can be hit or miss.

"I used to go bowling a lot, back in my younger days! I had decided on going on their website to call about holiday hours, and noticed all of the daily deals and packages they had listed. I thought they had some pretty decent deals. So the package they had offered on New Years Eve, was; -1 lane, up to 6 people, -10p till 1am, cosmic bowling style, shoe rental included, complimentary champagne toast for $99. Split between 3 couples sounded like a awesome deal. So we arrived an hour late, but luckily the people who were sitting in our area quickly readjusted their seating arrangements when we arrived, without us having to say anything to their group. Respect! Unfortunately I was disappointed in their ""cosmic"" scene, it was just bowling in the dark, they had no black lights on , nor up the lanes, and of their 4 disco lights they had on the ceiling, they only had 2 going which was on each end, and of course we were seated in the middle. The music wasn't engaging enough for the time and crowd. So i  was very disappointed in that aspect, and i think they should upgrade their cosmic bowling section. Next i noticed that other groups had brought in their own snacks and food, i thought that was brilliant, and was sad we didn't bring some goodies to snack on. So we all ended up ordering different things from the concession area. Tropicana has a good selection and the food is pretty decent. I ordered the mini tacos, they were so so, its what you would expect for fried food.  The fries was an enormous serving!, not complaining neither.  And i'd say the best thing i tasted were the wings, i liked that they were the party style and not those huge jumbo style of wings.

"I kept hearing decent things about this place, and have been wanting to try it out, but just never got around to it.  After nearly 2.5 years of living here, we finally ordered take out. 

I'm not really sure what the big deal is and why this gets good reviews.  The food is ""eh.""  

First of all, it's three different types of Asian cuisine:  Chinese, Japanese, and Thai.   I don't know, maybe it's me, but one cuisine at a time will suffice for me.   

The place was hopping, but I'm not surprised given the amount of restaurant choices around here, especially Asian.   There are quite a few crappy ""McDonald's""  type of Chinese food places.  Actually, no, that's not true, there's only one, they just have a perpetual ""Grand Opening.""  We get flyers in the mail all the time.  I don't know who they're trying to fool.  

Anyway, I ordered the crispy duck, which wasn't too bad.  Very filling, but that's just the way duck is.  It definitely was crispy.   It wasn't the best I've had.  The hubs ordered coconut chicken and was disappointed.   It was on the bland side.   We also ordered ""dim sum""  which was just your typical pot stickers and wontons.  That's fine and all, but that's not really a true dim sum sampler.   Just more crappy Chinese food.   

This is just one step up above crappy take out, only with a more expensive price tag.",2.0,0,1

"I absolutely love Shanti! Two years ago I started taking classes there with some yoga experience, but after one summer of classes a few times a week, I was hooked. I've been practicing religiously ever since. I only live in New Orleans in the summers, but when I'm in town, this is my go-to studio. I like that the classes are both physically demanding and challenging, but still enlightening and uplifting. This is not just some stretching and chanting here and there. You are going to sweat. A lot. But I take that as a good thing. You get a bomb workout, increased flexibility & strength, and mindfulness & awareness of one's self all in one class. 
Natalie's classes are my favorite. She knows how to push you and guide you into deepening your practice with constructive critique. You can feel yourself getting stronger with each class. The environment is safe and welcoming! Whether you're just beginning yoga or are more advanced, there are classes available for you. I find it hard in New Orleans to find studios that have more intermediate and advanced classes given most are beginner oriented, but Shanti covers all bases. 
There are many Groupon and online deals and discounts to make the classes more affordable. I often bring in friends who have never done yoga before using one of the discounts, and they all love it. I've tried many different studios, and Shanti remains my favorite. It stays true to its Ashtonga roots and the yoga practice while throwing in some power yoga features to its vinyasa flow.

They even measure them at the gate! You couldn't tell us we were wasting our money? So we go to another side of the park where they have go carts. TWO of them for a line of 30 people AND they both broke down!

We just came back from a weekend stay here with two rooms.

Hayden at the front desk was also another special star - he remembered our names and our family as we walked past the front desk several times; he gave us great recommendations for local spots; he took care of issues quickly. Other calls to the front desk were resolved efficiently

I also see that there're a few housekeeping related complaints here, but I didn't find that to be the case with our rooms (and we're pretty particular people)

We had two adjourning rooms in the Santa Cruz building, with balconies facing the parking lot. Noise, smells, etc. were not issues at all. I also didn't face any of the maintenance/aging issues that other commenters have mentioned here. True, the hotel style was more old-world charm than the hippest, trendiest decor, but everything worked. Even with all the baby stuff, we had more than enough room, and the appliances and amenities worked well.

"Tonight when I decided I was in the mood for pad thai but didn't quite know where to go, I turned to Google and simply did a thai food search and decided to go with the one in my area with the highest star rating! 

Risky since I live off of referrals to places from friends, but the star rating was so high I figured it had to be for a reason! 

We pulled up and initially questioned our decision when I was next to a laundromat....
As soon as we walked in that was the last moment we questioned anything! 

The first question when we arrived to our table was if we wanted a regular or vegan menu! We are vegetarians and are always looking for the vegan spots cuz we know they're always safe for vegetarians! So we were pretty excited to learn they had an entire vegan menu! 

My husband started with thai tea and I started with hibiscus tea. Thai teas can be really overly sweet sometimes. But not this one. This was perfect! And then we received a little plate of crackers and satay-ish type sauce. We asked if these were the shrimp crackers and were pleasantly surprised when she told us they were made from rice and sweet potato! Yay for us again!! 

I ordered tofu pad thai and my husband order was chili garlic tofu. Both blew us away! Fantastic flavors and perfect amount of spice without overpowering the flavor!

It took us about 30 minutes to get through the line that was out the door. Once up to the counter to order, the meats and sides were on display, and all of them looked good.

The southeast corn and cornbread salad were the winners. The green beans came in next and the Cole slaw was underwhelming. The biscuits were pretty tasty too. 

As far as meats, we liked the sausage the best and the burnt ends the least. 

We also got a bayou bar to go-shortbread crust with a cream cheese like center. Good, dense and rich enough to share.",4.0,2,2

"I went in for my first-ever Swedish massage after working a week-long tech conference. I scheduled my session with Brogan, and she was fantastic! Since she specializes in deep-tissue massages, she offered to start with a regular full body massage to get me acclimated to the massage, then try some deep tissue massaging on the most tense parts in my back and shoulders. She was super informative, and helped me understand the benefits of massages and deep tissue treatment, especially for people like me who spend a lot of time behind a computer!

The overall aesthetic was very calming, and it was the perfect experience to help me relax after a long, stressful week. I will definitely go back to Brogan, and have recommended her to my husband as well!",5.0,2,2
"The pizza is pretty good. Fresh but a little under seasoned. The food and decor get a 4. The 3 is for the bad service. Dining while black issues were huge. 

First, I had trouble getting the hostess to notice me. Next, came the ridiculous question: can I help you? I'm standing in a restaurant. You can help me to a table!! 

Second, hostess sat me at the WORST table. Less than 2 feet between my table and a group table. It was annoying and breezy as servers squeezed their butts past me to serve others. Finally, I was forced to sit in the other chair to avoid servers which gave a view of the kitchen. It's an open kitchen but not my choice. Especially since there was a nice two top away from the floor show. 

I was so mad I mentioned it to the server who apologized. Nice but my meal was ruined. Restaurants like to say black people are bad tippers. This is the reason why. I don't want to sit near a service area, near the bathroom, the server station or their server's pathway.",3.0,1,0

"Today my husband and I decided to use a gift card that we had gotten from our kids for Christmas. We opted for the couples massage. When we first arrived we checked in and we were told to be seated and just get comfy and relax, to be honest the couch we sat on was so comfortable I could've fallen asleep right then. Not before long we were greeted By Genna and Heather and we followed them into the treatment room, they explained what we needed to do and before long we were in relaxation heaven.  I'm going to be honest I've had many massages in the past and I have to say this was in the top three. The pressure was perfect the lighting in the room was perfect the temperature excellent if it wasn't for my husband who fell asleep and started snoring ( yes he did) and made me laugh out loud because he was so comfortable he was snoring, I would say it was a perfect experience and I honestly will be going back.

"This was my first time here and I was impressed for the most part! 
The massage was awesome, I got the 1hr full body for $70. The first 20 min was spent massaging while I was under the sheet, the next 20 minutes was with the sheet off with massage oil, then about 10 min with hot stones/hot towel, and then the last 10 min on my head/neck/temples. 
The massage therapist I got had a very relaxing rhythm, she would do one thing on one side and then go to the other and repeat it exactly the same, I could tell she was very practiced. 

I only had two small negatives, which weren't enough to give less than 5 stars. 
1- I had an appointment but when I showed up she still had me give all my info like I was a walk in and asked me what massage I wanted. Which was fine but I was there on a random Wednesday afternoon, had it been a weekend I'm sure they would have been more busy so I hope appointments are treated different.  
2- she didn't ask before putting on the oil or the hot stones, which may not bother most people but I just would have like to know before it happened but I guess I could see how talking could disrupt the relaxation? 

But overall a great experience, would definitely go back. It's two days later and while I was a little sore for a day all the tension/tightness in my back is gone and I feel great now.",5.0,2,1
"I'm the first person to give indie music shops and bookstores my business because, well, they're independent.  I love the fact that everything doesn't have to be brand new and current.  I see Barnes and Noble around the corner on Walnut Street has picked up on this by featuring vinyl (albeit new, nothing used) in the front of the store.

BUT ... I just visited there and was shocked at how high the prices were on everything.  Granted, their stuff is in mint (and like new or even new) condition, but, I'm sorry, I have a hard time buying a cassette tape for $6.99 (no joke).  I wouldn't mind paying that for vinyl (way better artwork to start with), but not for a tape.  No way.

They have vinyl, tapes, CDs, DVDs, and books.  They do not carry VHS tapes (none that I saw, anyway).  There is zero alphabetization in the place, so good luck in finding whatever it is you're looking for.  Although, on the plus side, music is categorized according to genre - rock, classical, jazz, etc.  

The DVDs are just piled here and there.  I didn't see any categorizing going on there.  And the books are loosely categorized.  Then again, the book section is anemic to say the least.

I have to admit I'm a sucker for their Soundtracks section on vinyl, but, again, I can only buy 2 albums or 3 at the most because it gets pricey at $5 or $7 a pop.  

Customers have to leave their bags and drinks at the counter (you're warned of this via signs on the door from the sidewalk) and they do play a variety of music from the store's sound system that can switch from psychedelic to jazz in an hour.  I like that.

Although located on a side street, parking is nearly impossible.  If you cannot find street parking, be prepared to part with a decent amount of money just to park on a piece of asphalt on any given day.  Hey, it's Center City and Rittenhouse Square is the pits when it comes to traffic.  It's always been that way.

In all, though, this place is worth a visit.  Just don't expect bargains - at all!  (Hey, someone has to pay the rent.)",4.0,2,0
"This restaurant is very Charming. 
It has good service and good quality food.
I decided on my way home from work that I wanted sushi and I wanted to try out a new place. I looked on yelp to see what's near by and Kami had great reviews so that was it, that's where I am headed. 
Parking in the area is not ideal, there are a few businesses around and such a tight parking lot plus it's winter. O don't forget the special people who thinks it's ok to double park... It's Edmonton we get it.

I walked in and it was a nice small but very neat and clean place. I am assuming that it was the owner who took my order and made the meals. He had a very nice smile, kind of reminds me of my dad. We had small talk while he was busy preparing the meal and then he said it was ready. He was impressively quick and I was off home in no time.
I ordered the BiBimBap Special w/ Spicy fresh sashimi for only $9.40. I opened it up at home and it smelled good and even better it tasted great! The ingredients were fresh and savory.

"While this place was in no way what I expected, that didn't work against it.

Instead of a traditional restaurant, you order your pizza at the counter and then head into the back where the pizza ovens are.

The large room, with the large tables makes it a great place to come with a large group of your friends and watch sports on the TV.  It's certainly designed to be a very public experience. If you are looking for something more intimate, this is probably not the place you want to visit.

"Brunch update!

I finally got to try out Vegan Commissary for brunch, after hearing that it was a must-eat vegan meal. I organized a group of around 10 of us to hit up VC on a Saturday last weekend at 11. As soon as we all arrived, the servers put a few tables together and we sat down. The service, overall was very good, over the course of the meal: attentive and fast.

My husband and I split the mini cinnamon roles which were sweet, soft and wonderful. Next, we split two dishes: the veggs Damien and the poached avocado. The veggs Damien was by far my favorite dish! I have been missing soft boiled eggs, and this dish captured them completely. The mushroom grits on the side were very bad. But the toast, ""eggs"", broccolini and home fries made up for that in spades. I was full after half of this dish!

I have two complaints and they are kind deal breakers. One, the coffee is very pricey, they charge if you want refills, the one cup I had was the size of an espresso cup, and the coffee itself was weaker than Wawa coffee. I did enjoy the coconut creamer, but otherwise, it was a total waste of money! 

And two, we got some serious attitude the morning of our event. I had received a message from VC asking that we ""call ahead"" to let them know exactly how many were coming. So, my husband called that morning a couple of hours before we got there, and was told that calling wasn't necessary and that they could not hold a table for us. Basically, he was given serious attitude for FOLLOWING VEGAN COMMISSARY'S DIRECTIONS and calling them. I don't think I'll be back after that attitude, honestly.

Luckily for us there wasn't a line when we arrived. I ordered a puffle cone with pumpkin & Reese's. My husband ordered a donut cone with coffee and white choc chips. It was pricey around 15 for the 2.

The puddle cone came pretty quickly but the doughnut cone took almost 15 min.

I really liked the pumpkin icecream and puffle cone it reminds me of a Belgium waffle. 

The doughnut cone was served in a cup bc it melts so fast from the warm cone & drips out the bottom. The coffee lacked flavor (they mix syrup in the plain mix to get flavor) so maybe they didn't put enough flavor in it. The cone also seemed raw in the middle to me. I didn't like that and at a cost of over 8.00 & taking 15 min to get I was disappointed in that one. My husband however said it was fine so he ate most of that. He said it was more like a cinnamon roll consistency than a donut.

"This place just opened so I am given the benefit of the doubt. This place could be a hit or miss. Keep in mind they just opened so there is room for improvement. I believe pricing is a little high for the quality and quantity of  the food. I started off with the octopus thinking was going to be enough since I wasn't too hungry, which I must say it was tasty but very small divided into 2 little tentacles. I have visited some of the most upscales Greek and Italian restaurants and for that price or a little more you get at least a whole tentacle. Has to ask for a side of mashed potatoes which surprisedly was a great portion. Their pasta is also a very small portion keep it in mind it was $22 with just a marsalla sauce in it with no meat. Their mezcal drink was good but I don't think will be something I will ask again. They won't carry agave for their drinks. Their vibe was good but too clubby for what I heard from other tables. It's definitely not kid friendly as they don't cater a kids menu. FYI: kids love pasta and $22 for a kid is too much. Everything was good but quite frankly not Master chef good. Don't take me wrong I won't mind paying for great food but coming here hungry will drain your bank account. I don't think having a Master Chef behind your name justifies high pricing and small portions. Even yout bread is divided in 3 small pieces. The server was awesome.

"Stopped by for lunch while working in Nashville. It was our first time to a place like this, so I am not sure if it could be done better, but man did this hit the spot.

As other reviewers say, you pay for a sized bowl, which you then fill from the buffet bar of raw ingredients: veggies galore, meats, spices, sauces, and oils. They have tips for you (for example, if you want to make a dish spicy, add half a ladle of chili sauce), and for the truly overwhelmed, they have a small menu to order from. However, to order from the menu would do Khan's a disservice.

We both got the large bowls, then realized as we ate that we could have had a Leaning Tower of Stir Fry on our bowls (we only filled them to the top; did not overfill like the others we saw there). I made sure to remind Husband to add enough sauce to cover the starches, which would be added behind the counter. The cashier had a thick accent, but was very efficient. I got the white rice, and Husband got the noodles. They even have giant bottles of hand sanitiizer by the register and door (which is totally necessary because even though the meat is frozen, there is still bacteria!). 

It wasn't too long, even with how slammed they were, to get our order. The food was delicious. Each entree is served with a cup of thick, delicious stir fry sauce, which is especially helpful if you don't put enough sauce on your meal prior to them grilling it. It was a really neat experience, and our end results were delicious.

GREAT option for vegetarians, and for people like me who like a little meat but more veggies.",4.0,2,1

"Nice clean place, with some parking in front of the store.  I came in on an early Saturday afternoon after receiving an email for 6 free doughnuts.  I didn't know what to expect, but the nice lady at the counter asked if it was my first time in and explained to me that they sell tiny doughnuts.  While waiting for the six free sugar doughnuts, I decided to order two of the lemon blueberry doughnuts, but I was informed that the smallest order that they do is six.  I decided not to get them at this time...
Another young lady took six doughnuts and placed them into a bowl full of granulated sugar and started to mix them around.  Once completed they were placed into a small bag and off I went.
On touch, you could feel that they were still warm.  At first glance, they appeared to be more of a doughnut hole, than an actual doughnut.  The flavor was ok, nothing stood out, but I didn't expect a sugar doughnut to stand out either.
I am not sure if I agree on the price point for these doughnuts, ($5 or $6 sorry I forgot which) for 6 of them, seems a bit high.  If the lemon blueberry are good, then I may be ok with a splurge of six now and then.",3.0,1,0

For lunch, they have lunch express special, which is about $15/person. it's everything on a small chopping board. You can get half sandwich or gyro and some salads. Very tasty and fresh! For dinner, I would recommend ordering a few small plates and share with your friends. They have a cheese appetizer (I forgot the name), the server would use the lighter to make the top smoky and crispy, it's very tasty! 

This place can get very busy during dinner time, but often pretty empty for lunch. The price for drink and food is reasonable. I will keep going back!",5.0,2,2
"Here's my take.

This restaurants buffet honestly can be hit or miss. They have periods of rushes of people coming in and getting the buffet; other times they are completely empty. I honestly wouldn't recommend getting the buffet before doing a quick glance before hand.

I don't come here for the buffet I always get a fresh meal. I love this place because I love spicy food and feel like not enough places serve it to my spice level. If you order Indian hot I promise tears will run down your face.

The chicken tikki masala is good but one expects it has to be good for the amount of calories packed into that sauce. They serve their naan fresh and it's delicious! I always opt for something from the tandoori oven or one of their specials. I'm planning on trying the mixed tandoori grill platter next time.

Their meals are filling and worth every penny. I see a lot of people complaining about the buffet, just get a meal next time.",5.0,2,2
"Disappointed!  After reviews we were looking forward to a good meal.  We started with the octopus special - some pieces were mushy - not good for octopus.  Others were good and with red sauce and not too bad.  Caesar was not bad - they topped with tortilla strips for crunch.  Odd.  The Caribbean conch chowder was a disappointment.  Definitely did not taste any conch.  Had a couple bites and that was it.  I ordered scallops.  They were cooked well however the sauce was a glorified cream of mushroom sauce served with a large piece of steamed broccoli.

"My fiance and I decided to have my brother be our wedding officiant, but since he had never written a ceremony before we thought it'd be a good idea to have a professional write it for us.

She has two options when writing a ceremony, and we went with the more personalized one-and I'm so happy that we did! She sent us a questionnaire which was a great way for us to reflect on ourselves and us as a couple before the wedding. From our answers, she crafted a beautiful and very personalized ceremony.

"Decided to give this place a second chance after not loving it last year and still stunk. The service is what makes me dislike this place so much. Every server, bartender and host we've had here has been rude, cocky and obnoxious and trust me, I'm not a fussy diner. 

When we went on saturday the bartender judged what we were ordering, and not in an ""i dont recommend that item"" fashion, he was just being a jerk. I got a pretty gross smelling glass for my margarita (that wet dog, not washed properly smell) that made it hard to drink. Wasn't that tasty regardless of the glass smell. The pitcher wasn't exactly worth $32 either that was quite lacking on alcohol. I do appreciate their flavors and variety like having a tamarind margarita and extensive tequila menu. 

The food is good actually and I liked the tacos I got here last year but its nothing outstanding, innovative, or generously portioned. I would give it 3 or 4 stars for the food but just the rude service and prices bring it down so much.  Their menu does have a lot of great options and I would like to try their tamales one day, but I can do without stepping in here again.

Whip cream was over whipped but they can figure that out. Almost as good as Houston's!,5.0,2,2

"I highly recommend having Mia do your nails here! I was in St. Petersburg for business and needed to find a great nail salon for SNS and found this place through Yelp. I always use the same salon/tech in Atlanta and was very nervous to try a new nail spa as I've had bad experiences with SNS and other nail technicians in the past. 

I asked for the best SNS nail technician, the manager recommended Mia, and she did an all-around amazing job!! I like the sns thin and shaped square/round: my nails turned out perfectly--great hand massage, too! The greeting up front was energetic and welcoming, the atmosphere is extremely relaxing, and everything is very clean (which is the most important).",5.0,2,2
"My mom and I discovered this little gem back in 2000, where we came for our little ""girls getaway/spring break."" 

The rooms are refreshed on a regular basis and are pretty comfortable and stylish, without being overwhelming. The entire hotel has a relaxed resort attitude and look. No pretentions!

Each visit is different for us. We've had spectacular ocean views, a rooftop air conditioning view (blegh!), intercoastal way views, and even noisy neighbors at 2-4 am! So each time is different.

Their breakfast buffet at Rusty's Bistro, is spectacular, but we usually just prefer to order off the menu. Their side dishes together get you a tailored breakfast if you have special diet needs.

Their dinners are featured out front by the restaurant entrance, and are always breathtakingly displayed and absolutely delicious looking.

The little Island Grille has a great selection of lunchtime favorites.

The poolside cafe has the same menu as the little food van on the beach. I really liked their salad with Newman's Own Italian dressing.

If there was something I could change about this hotel is 1) the price for the rooms, and 2) the difficulty of getting a room since the have some many special and corporate events! 3) they moved their Internet capable computers from a dedicated business lounge to the bar -- the bar!! What if you're not 21?

Their white, sandy beach features great rental cabanas right by the sea, or a sand volleyball setup near to the pool area. The pool area is lovely, although the pool is mostly frequented by families with children and isn't really for adults. Even after hours! There is a hot tub nearby, behind some medium-height shrubbery.

They have a great gym and massage service at the top floor. There's a hair dresser in the hotel across the street.

This is definitely a hotel to try if you're in the Clearwater/Clearwater Beach area. Beware if you use Expedia or another intermediary, as the hotel can't help you AT ALL with your reservation -- whether you need to extend the stay or anything else. Again, they're almost always booked solid and you better figure out your plans well ahead of time before you make your reservation.",3.0,1,2
"This was our first time, but it won't be our last. Our waitress was terrific, prompt, personable, and accommodating. The cinnamon roll was huge, as big as my husbands head, and he has a big head!

"Stay away!!! This dentistry gave me wrong diagnosis and tried to do scaring technics  KRISTINA was doing  most of talking by scaring me and telling me that I must to remove 14 teeth since I have severe periodontal desease. When I asked what is my other options besides removing 14 teeth? She told me this is the only option I have, when I asked if I can rebuild the missing bone in my gums she said NO.  I'm  35 years old healthy person that just came to do check up and get regular teeth cleaning without any problems or complains. Kristina and Dr Mai was very pushing and told me that they can remove all 14 teeth in one day!? Or I can split it for 2 visits. She put disgusting pictures on TV in front of my face and told me that my teeth is almost in same condition and I must to remove them before the infection will spread to my front teeth. After she showed me the pictures and told me that I knew that something is wrong because my teeth are white nothing like the pictures she showed me. She was pushing me to get treatments (including expensive crown that was way over priced compared to other places I checked)  that worth  over $4700 even that I have dental insurance. She made me appointment for the very next day to remove 6 teeth plus deep cleaning and one crown- all that in one appointment. After I came home I called my mother and told her the story and she told me this is lie, that I can fix the missing bone and no one removing teeth because of periodontal desease. So I start to do research and I found out that this clinic giving $50 for people that giving them positive reviews this is the reason they have so many good reviews on their website. In this moment I cancelled my appointment with Mai dentistry and made appointment with different dentist for second opinion. Thanks God the other dentist  told me that im fine ( I do have periodontal desease but no infection and he referred me to periodontal specialist that also confirmed  that I'm fine I just need deep cleaning and not removing any teeth) he did for me the cleaning and fix my front teeth while DR Mai told me I need a crown on that teeth that will cost me $740. Please stay away from this place it breaks my heart to know that so many people going to this dentist office based on good reviews.

"After all the rave reviews, I have been wanting to try this restaurant and I love me some good fried chicken. We got there on a Monday afternoon and waited for almost an hour. We had a party of 6. We were running a little behind to go the airport, so we asked to order right away. The waitress didn't even want to take our order and kept walking around doing other things besides helping us. She came back 10 min later to take our order. We ordered 3 fried chicken plates and 1 fried fish and some sides to share. There were a bunch of tables that came in after us. Our order took 40 min to come out! Every single table that came in after us got their food our first. It was extremely frustrating. 

Finally when our food came out. We asked waitress for some ranch and ketchup and she looked at us like we were asking for something crazy. She was extremely rude and did not know how to treat customers at all. 

The fried chicken was gross. It was sooo greasy that it was oozing out of the chicken. The chicken was so dark and burnt and there was no batter, just greasy salty skin that was falling off the meat. The mashed potatoes were bland, the okra was not even good either. There was absolutely nothing good about this restaurant to be raving about. On top of that the service was awful.

"After being a patient here for over twenty years I came to be evaluated for an organ transplant The dr. (KOHLI) who doesn't even know me doesn't even try to get to know me. He's cold and rude. During this so called evaluation he doesn't even listen to me with a stethoscope. After 10 minutes of reading my very large chart he decides I am not a worthy candidate but sends me on my way with a ""well we need to take a look at this and this etc., etc.,"". Now after waiting about three months and hearing nothing in between I get a letter (a letter, they couldn't even take the time to call me)  stating they are rejecting me as a candidate for the procedure. My entire twenty year experience has been full of encounters with very gossipy, arrogant, condescending, insulting nurses and doctors who were totally unprofessional. They make on the spot diagnosis such as your depressed (because you are sleeping too much), and I then had this repeated to me weeks later in the outpatient department (stuff rolls down hill?), had nurses talk through the intercom to me while I was sleeping about various religious denominations in the presence of a Dr.(HAHA), write rude comments in my chart which were discovered in other medical departments. Had one Dr tell me I am not really disabled (although the government disagrees.) Best of all had an endocrinologist diagnose and note in my chart that I had a mood disorder!!  Had to go through the hospitals HIPPA office to request its removal and had to threaten them with slander charges since it was at ""their prerogative"" as to whether they would remove it or not.

"Great coffee shop that makes its coffee artisan style mixing different flavors together. The coffee they have is very smooth and flavorful.

"This has become my favorite restaurant in South Jersey. As the other reviews say, it's a tapas-style restaurant, but not to be confused with Spanish tapas where you order many small dishes. That being said, 4 courses including soup and salad are totally reasonable if you're a big eater. I really appreciate the simplicity of the recipes, and how fresh the ingredients are. The food is sourced locally, and prepared by an expert. The flavors are almost always great, and not overpowering.

I called ahead of time to see if they could accommodate to vegans and they said yes (typically mexican is very easily made vegan anyway but i like to check).

It was so bland and season-less I added guacamole and salsa that came out with the chips. They do start you off with free chips and salsa which is nice. After a while we did not see our waitress again... and other staff were sitting at tables playing on their phones. This was kind of a red flag for a big Mexican place on a Saturday night.

"Chill and hipster vibe away from the crowds. Great negroni. RACHED banh mi sandwich. 

+ seating for days no matter the size of your crew.  Check out the Huge seating area for a ""private"" group of 20 friends. Awesome spot for it. 
+ welcoming host staff
+ open kitchen concept but there is no counter or tables which look in. 
+ draught beer taps go on for yards and yards. Probably 40-50 on tap! Cool!
+ really great vibe for a central city hangout!

But this is yelp and it's about the food and it was RACHED!

## banh mi. Korean ""roasted chicken"", my ass! That was the nastiest RACHED pork, drowned in a pitiful gloopy gloop sauce I have ever endured. And I had only one bite. 
## fries cold and dead, old. 
## roll would be better described as a pretzel loaf, hard, chewy, not what i expect for a banh mi.

I asked for cod fish and verduras and received sauteed cod fish with a lettuce and tomato salad, while palladable it was far from authentic.

"There isn't enough positive words to say about this place! Aftering enduring a lot of pain and a really red eye, I decided (or was convinced) to see an eye doctor. At first I was hesitant to go here because my insurance isn't local and I wanted the eye to heal on it's own. Boy, am I glad I changed my mind.

Their prices were very reasonable (I paid $55 without insurance to save my vision) and they squeezed me in last minute. I had no wait and they were very welcoming. The doctor really went out of the way to get to know me and understand my problems.The pain I suffered was due to an ulcer on my cornea. He immedietely prescribed me an antibiotic and educated me on this issue. 

I was seen just before the holiday and was squeezed in for a follow-up right before the Thanksgiving to ensure I was healing quickly and properly. 

In short: if you are in doubt, go here! These two visits have been nothing but a great experience (not bad, considering I was in a lot of pain before I went in!)",5.0,2,2

We chose to sit outside since the weather was as perfect as it could get in New Orleans. The courtyard is beautiful as the sun begins to set. 

I was persuaded by the server into ordering the café pasta special, which was chock full of garlic, andouille sausage, tomatoes and flavor, and topped with more than enough parmigiano reggiano. It was probably one of my favorite dishes, of all that I tasted. I was craving pasta and this really hit the spot. I should have ordered a glass of red wine with it to help wash down the strong flavors.

"I am soo happy with their prompt service & attention to detail. My yard has been a spiraling disaster. I price searched for months & chose this company because they included pest control. Their price was slightly higher than others, but here is what I get:
1. The crew comes out weekly whether it's mowing, hedging, or pulling weeds.
2. I get to sit back & relax- the other crew I used only came out every other week & missed all types of things. 
$149/mo -I'm so Jew, but I clearly can not give my yard what it needs, so time for help!

So here is the best part! I called them yesterday morning around 8:30. I came home from work around 5:40 to a pleasant surprise! They even edged around my trees & bushes & stones & fireplace!

"It was a travesty when they closed the Arco Iris Restaurant at Columbus.  They had the best pork chunks in Tampa Bay.  When I drove by and saw they had closed, I was devastated. 

Imagine my surprise when I found out about Arco Iris Cafe!  It's the same folks.  I read some story about their lease not being renewed after 30 years, but about 10 years ago they suspected something and opened this place as a backup. 

Visionary. 

They seem to have brought over the chef. The food is just as I remember.  This is the place to order pork chunks.  As an appetizer or as a platter with rice and beans.  Maybe some fried yuca or sweet plantains on the side.  The service is competent, prices are low, the atmosphere is authentic Tampa Cuban.

Our reservation was for Saturday at 7:30, which was apparently too early to eat because the place was practically deserted.  By the time we finished, the place began to fill up, but the peacefulness of the early part of the meal shed light on the waiter's constant mumbling...offering no help with the menu.  

So the service was average, but the food was delicious.  I had Samosas for an appetizer 7/10 , extra Naan 10/10, and the Chicken Hariyali (spicy) 9/10 for an entree.  We also got the Gulab Jamun for desert (5/10).  Someone in my party got a Tandoori Special, and after having a taste, I was very happy I didn't go for that.  It was 80% rice and a lot less chicken than what I got.

"About a year and a half ago we contacted with this company to replace our AC system. We went with this company because the owner was a former Navy Seabee and my wife and I are both former active duty Navy.  We felt that supporting a company owned by a veteran was the right thing to do and that he would treat veterans as well as all his customers fairly. How wrong we were. Last Friday our blower motor on the air handler would not turn off.  We called and the technician arrived early Monday morning. He diagnosed the problem as a bad blower motor which would have to be replaced. The unit was under warranty so there would be no charge for parts, but a $350 labor charge. Given the amount of the labor charge I assumed it was a bigger job. Silly me. The technician arrived early Tuesday morning with a new motor and installed it. He was here less than an hour which included doing the billing paperwork. When I asked how he could justify a $350 labor charge plus a $54.95 service call charge for a simple job, he explained it was company policy to charge $350 for all warranty labor, regardless of how long the job took. WE paid the bill since and I immediately called the company to complain. Angel, the operations or general manager called me back and seemed surprised that I was upset with charges. He said the he hasn't raised the prices in 7 years and that the company had expenses to cover and no one has ever complained before. What it boils down to is that customers who have minor or smaller warranty repairs are subsidizing those customers who have large repairs. I would not have a problem paying a fair hourly rate, but $350 plus a $54.95 borders on the ridiculous. The company's unscrupulous but legal billing policy has insured they will never receive another dime from me. If solicited by this company run, run fast and run far.",1.0,0,0

The negatives are the food was bland and cold. I mean the  fries that accompanied my chicken salad sandwich were hard and cold. The bun on my sandwich was good and toasted which was great if the rest of the meal wasn't cold. Another decent thing was they used the thin sliced pickles that were the width of the sandwich which was appeasing to me and my obsession with good pickles.

Came here for lunch with my mom and sister last weekend and we all really enjoyed the food and atmosphere! The staff was incredibly nice and even brought us taquitos on the house which were so good! The sauce on them was stellar-- velvety and the best combo of savory and sweet. The meat inside was tender and full of flavor. We ordered a variety of almost all of the tacos and we were happy with all of them- you really can't go wrong! My only complaint was that the tortilla was a little thick for my texture preference but you could tell they were super fresh which was awesome. The trio of dips to start with were delicious. I never order guacamole out at a restaurant because I make it at home often but this one was absolutely perfect!! I would definitely come back here again!

"I was in the area and wanted to eat something that was quick and healthy. I went on my  trusty Yelp app since I wasn't familiar with the area. The Grill is an unexpected treat past the produce section of the store. I ordered the Pesto Grilled Chicken & Swiss Sandwich,  full of flavor and tasty.

"Went there specifically for the pizza as it was supposed to be half-price pizza night.  When we arrived I said to my friend I don't see any signs for half-price pizza night. So we ordered our food sat outside (best part of the restaurant). She ordered the Margerity and I ordered the broccoli rabi. Ordered that arugula salad first (the greens were really tough) the salad itself was tasty. Neither one of us thought the pizza was so great it was nice and brown on the top and should have been crispy delicious on the bottom. It was really soggy. Mine not as bad as hers. We ordered three different kinds of ice cream that we could share. They used a melon baller for the dips. Then the check came and we noticed we were being charged full price for the pizza. The reason I knew about the half-price because I was on their emails. I thought that was for everyone. It said on the web-side which I did not pay attention to that there were three pizzas that night at half price. That was my fault but you had to give them the password on the web page to get them at half-price. What a childish game. Because my friend had ordered one of the three I said I thought she should give it to us half-price. She put on her attitude face and changed the bill. 

I don't know what they are gaining by playing this little game but I think it is totally unfair to the rest of their customers. It should be for everyone. From what I just read
on their site I see Wednesday is 1/2 price on certain bottles of wine (didn't see any password for that). Don' t think I will be going back there soon unless they change their unfair policies. 

Their half-price nights should be for everyone not for just a select few.

This place has okay food.  Problem is it is one of the slowest places to order and to get your food I have been.  If you have 4 hours to burn this is your place!  Not recommended!,1.0,0,0
the service and the ambiance were great. my friends and i came here for prom dinner and really had no complaints. we were a small group of three girls and we shared a margarita pizza along with crab mac and cheese. that was more than enough food for us. it is a little bit expensive but the food was great and well worth it!,4.0,2,2

I  hesitated to use these guys a no brand name company. The pick up and drop off was a nice touch - unfortunately there was a lot of construction going on with roads being block our pick up was late. Not only did the compensate us with extra time they said they would work with us on the mileage. We had to go to Lafayette for the day which ate up the 150 miles they give you per day. The cars are not 'new' our cars had a few dings on it. What car doesn't have a few dings on it after being parked in the French Quarter with a bunch of crazy fun loving people bang up against it. I was worried that we might add to the cars collection of dings parking it on Frenchmen street. The driver who picked us up told us where to park that was safe. The big sell was to get a car for the day without going to the airport it was just too much of a hassle. It was a very positive experience for us. Everyone was very friendly -,5.0,2,0
"The service from Bruce and Aileen is 5 star for sure! Helpful, friendly, accomodating which are all the qualities of great customer service.  The beds are comfortable,  the room is  clean and spacious for a hotel. They have seals on the door so you know when they've been cleaned and you break the seal upon entry. The upkeep is excellent bc this area is definitely a mecca for visitors. So why 4 instead of 5 stars?  1) I asked Hilton directly on their 800 line for a discount on a second room for our teenage daughters and there are PLENTY of rooms available and they said no. Even if we paid 50% for the room next door, they would have made a profit rather than leaving it empty. 2) Understandably, the breakfast is a stocked bar of pre-packaged items bc of Covid concerns, but no tea and no hot cocoa is a bummer since there is coffee. Also no fresh fruit and most items are high sugar, low nutrient type foods.",4.0,2,2

Went as a party of 6 and the wait time was relatively short. The restaurant is warm and inviting. Their wait staff is extremely wonderful; quick attentive, respectful.

"Love this company! A+ Colin and his crew are incredible! They were on time, professional, easy to communicate with, friendly and always do a great job detailing my 2016 Porsche Macan. No complaints at all from me! They always return my phone calls and texts promptly. Flexible hours. Easy to arrange service and coordinate with my hectic schedule. Colin is extremely knowledgeable about how to clean and care for my vehicle. I also noticed that they use the best products. Executive always has their own water and electricity so there is no need to hookup to my property and use my utilities. One thing that I always worry about when I hand over my car keys to a service, whether it be a valet at a resturaunt or a detailing service like Executive, is the safety of my belongings while I leave it unsupervised. Executive is 100% trustworthy - I leave my fairly expensive sunglasses in my car as well as an iPod and one time I even left my Apple Watch in my vehicle while Executive detailed it. I dont trust just anyone with my car. Executive has experience working with every make and model of luxury vehicle out there, even boats, RV's, & campers. This made me feel very comfortable letting them care for my brand new Porsche. Finally, Colin is unbelievably knowledgeable about how to care for and protect both the interior and exterior of my car. I was very impressed with how passionate and skilled he and his crew are - they do amazing work. Love this company! Would recommend using them if you need a basic wash or if you are like me and want to keep your vehicle looking just as good as the day you drove it off the lot, give Executive a call for the best detail in the city.",5.0,2,2

"We are usually seated quickly and waters served promptly but when it comes time to place our order it seems to take awhile.  So waitress just came by, 1:32pm.  We'll see how long it takes for the food to get here. I ordered the trip tip dip with a salad and my husband ordered Bob's Big Bear Burger Deluxe  with a salad.  The salads came out in 4 minutes.  Pretty quick and not a bad size side salad.  Burger and sandwich came out 4 minutes after the salad. Doing good today.
Last time my dad and I came for breakfast it took over 30 minutes to get our food and then it was cold. My scrambled eggs we runny and my dad's over medium looked Sunnyside up and greasy.
My husband's burger was so good and the portion was huge, he had to cut it into quarters,  but they forgot the bacon in the deluxe part.  Waitress, marleen, fixed the problem. She was real apologetic and very friendly.   My tri tip dip had great flavor and I could only eat half.  Good review here!",4.0,2,1
"I've been to a lot of gyms in my life to date but Sierra Fitness comes out on top of the list.

The staff are friendly and always welcoming. 

Dan, the owner, helped me out with a rotator cuff issue where physiology therapists failed. He also got me back on track after falling off the fitness wagon for a while. He eased me back in at my pace by pushing me just enough beyond my comfort zone, without paralyzing me for days, as other coaches in the past have done. It was fun and knowledgable working out with Dan.

I'd highly recommend a few one on one's for anyone wanting to get back to it or for those wanting to push things further.

The atmosphere in the gym is relaxed and friendly. You'll get a peaceful workout and will not be surrounded by meatheads checking themselves out in the mirrors! Workouts are supposed to be enjoyable...I always managed that here!

My wife really loved the classes on offer also. While I'm more into the gym, than group classes, Hazel, one of the trainers, does the best conditioning classes you will ever find. She won't let you slack either so be careful, as I found out from my father in law, when you pick up that heavier weight, thinking, I've got this! :)

"This is my nearest McDonald's.  We get drive-through lunch OR sit-in breakfast about once a week.  I haven't experienced the slowness or the rudeness that others are reporting.  Being regulars, the staff all know us, talk to our kids and our orders only rarely have had mistakes.  If we do get a mistake, its been fixed promptly without issue.  Miss Victoria at the drive-thru has a dazzling smile that I always appreciate.  Miss Natalie at the front counter is fast, efficient and can handle a lot at a time.  She keeps things moving.  Mr. Joe in the dining area is ALWAYS on top our needs, holding a door open for all the kiddos, bringing a high-chair for the little one, helping a bigger kid to get ice in his cup.  

I do have to say that I've seen the manager get angry with employees if they are new or make a mistake and he's been quite mean to them in front of other employees and customers.  

Other than that, the restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is hot and good.  I've never gotten cold food or frozen hash-browns.",4.0,2,2

"Great Menu choices and reasonable prices.  Drive thru wasn't crowded.  Husband had some questions about things and the young lady over yet another messed up intercom, couldn't answer them,  she had to get a menu and was yelling at someone about the items.  We placed our order.  Waited almost 20 minutes because our order was messed up.  The young ladies were very flustered and confused with barely 6 customers, combination of the drive thru and outside dining area.  We were given extra drinks for the long wait, which you know in thus Florida humidity and heat is appreciated.  They were ice cold and so good.   We ordered the foot long chili dogs with tater tots fir husband and mozzarella sticks for me.  The oil needs to be changed in the fryer.  Tater tots tasted like fish and potatoes.  Mozzarella sticks tasted like fish and cheese.  Chili on hot dogs was a little salty but rest of it tasted great.  2nd time there.  We'll budget out a few bucks again and return.  Give it a try! :-)",3.0,1,1
"Never had Georgian cuisine so got my family to come try this place with me and was not disappointed! The place has a cozy neighborhood feel but with a pretty nice, well decorated interior, and was packed when we came in for lunch on a weekend. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us and set us up downstairs. 

Of course their specialty is breads, especially the cheese-filled khatchapuri, so we had to get one of those; it came super warm and fresh, with an egg cracked over and mixed into the molten cheese right at our table. The bread and cheese were awesome, so simple but so tasty together. We also tried the veal ojakhuri (veal chunks fried with potatoes onions and herbs) which was meaty and filling. I'm not a big pickle fan, but my dad got the pickled veggie platter as a side and seemed to like them. The khinkali (thick dumplings filled with juicy, almost soupy ground meat and herbs) were surprisingly flavorful, meaty, and full of herbs that give it a fresh and interesting flavor profile. Our last entree, the chkmeruli (chicken cooked in milk, garlic, and coriander) was surprisingly good, with the juicy and crispy skin chicken floating in the refreshing, slightly creamy milk sauce. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the kharcho meat soup, which could've used a bit more flavor.

Overall, for my first time trying Georgian cuisine, I was super satisfied and super full! Everything here definitely felt fresh and home made, and I can't wait to come back and try some of their other bread specialties and meat dishes.",4.0,2,2

"My first and most likely last time trying Domino's- I miss Pizza Hut. The bbq chicken pizza was just ok. The cheese stuffed breadsticks were a huge let down- it was like stale pizza crust with some cheese on them. Also the girl that waited on us had no personality at all- no greeting when we came in. Then I ordered extra marinara for my breadsticks and didn't get it. My bf went back in and then she said it wasn't supposed to come with sauce but I know it was because it says it is online number one, number 2 I had the discussion with her before I ordered the two extra on how many it came with because we like a lot of sauce. Then she acted like she just gave it to us for free but I paid extra for those. Also we got wings and I only ate one and my son only ate a half of one- and we both didn't like them-not sure why they don't put sauce in their boneless wings just to dip. Also the bill was $59 and some change for pizza, breadsticks and wings. I thought maybe the price was wrong so I asked for a receipt when I wasn't given one and the price was right. $19 and change for the bbq chicken pizza and $15 for the half sausage, half plain. I could've ordered from Olive Garden and at least got a good breadstick for $60.",2.0,0,0
"The Grand Marketplace provides indoor shopping for all occasions. There are many stores to choose from and it even includes an indoor flea market. There is a food court and stores for every need. You could find both new and used items here. 

There is a larger Amish food court on the other end. They are only there during certain times though. 

The Grand Marketplace can be compared to the Pennsauken Mart which is now closed. Some of the stores from the Pennsauken Mart have moved over to the new Grand Marketplace. If you went there alot, you'll see some familiar faces.

I must say, the layout at Grand Marketplace sucks! Its easy to walk around and miss an aisle or two. This makes it much harder to remember where some stores are. Some are hidden almost so keep track of which aisles you've already gone through.",3.0,1,2

This place has good, consistent, flavorful food.  It is an ""upscale"" chain.  Meaning, in the world of basic Mexican cuisine, more on the menu than Taco Bell.  Want 5-star? Go to one of Rick Bayless' restaurants in Chicago.  Want great local Mexican? This is it.  Great service, unique menu items, always consistent, always good.  I recommend Abuelo's every time for local, decent Mexican or Tex-Mex.  They even offer sopapillas with warm honey and cinnamon/sugar, something I'm 100% sure Hoosiers cannot identify.

"I love this quaint little spot in Wesley Chapel.  They are very welcoming every time I visit.  

I always get the same dish, the Mixed Grill, I switch out the hummus for Baba Ghanouj. Every bite is delicious and flavor packed.

I still haven't tried their Turkish coffee, that will be on my next stop.  The food is hot and tastes fresh every time.  

If you are looking for a non-chain restaurant, this is the place for you.  It's a small deli style restaurant.

I tried a few different things here, but as always used the chocolate croissant as my barometer. The chocolate croissants were amazing; buttery, flaky, and just melted in the mouth. I also tried the almond croissant. This was my first time trying it and I have to say, I'm surprised by how much I liked it. It's got toasted almonds on top and an almond paste filling. The filling is sweet, but not too over powering. Finally, I couldn't resist trying the eclair. It was excellent. The pastry was very light and the creme pâtissière filling was some of the best I've had.",4.0,2,2

"I am shocked by the reviews for fast food places. 1.5 stars? Are you kidding me?! If a fast food joint gets your order right, it should be at least 3 stars! If the food is good and fills your belly because you needed to eat something right away, it deserves more. That being said, KFC has done something right with the Classic and Spicy Chicken Sandwiches. Depending on which KFC you go to, you will enjoy a sandwich that easily rivals (and even beats in some cases) Popeyes. I am saying this with all honesty... I did not trust KFC because of the inferior sandwich I received at KFC, 716 Adams Ave. I thought KFC was putting one over on us with the crunchy coated sandwich in the ads and the limp, barely crisped piece of sh*t the 716 Adams KFC served me. It was not until I tried a better version of the sandwich from 411 Oregon Avenue and then an even better version at this KFC location that I became a believer. The chicken breast is legitimately huge and juicy  like Popeye's chicken sandwich on a good day. I was pleasantly surprised by the nice crunchy coating, lightly toasted buttered bun, sauce, and pickles.

I don't give a d*mn about customer service at a fast food place, especially a drive-through. All I care about is the food. The chicken sandwich here is stupendous. Get it! Plus, watch my YouTube review here for even more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrBgFJ2fy0&t=681s",4.0,2,2

"What rock have you been living under if you haven't had a slice?

Then I noticed they over charged us on a dish by $15.00 When I brought to the attention of my waiter, it took him a  1/2 hr. to fix it. This left a sour taste in my mouth. Not sure if I'd return to this place.",2.0,0,0

"We have been going to the Boot since theY opened their first location in Lafayette Hill.  Love that location and the one in Ambler.  The food is excellent, as is the service.

BUT...this is NOT the case at this loCation.  The service simply sucked.   ThE place was almost empty.   It took our  waitress a reminder from us after 15 minutes of waiting to just take our order.  I asked about the bread at that time.  Then the salad came and I again asked avpbout bread.  15 minutes later after finishing thE salad, during which time no one checked in on us, I asked the hostess to please get us thE bread. That finally arrived.  The pasta was gOod but not up to standard.  The meatballs were tough and the bolognese was bland.

"BBQ is like Italian food because it's easy to do mediocrely. Mission exceeds.

I'll get to the food shortly. First I'll address the GM, Nick. He asked if we had been in before, I had, my wife had not. He explained how they prepare everything fresh everyday and pointed out that they don't even have microwaves or freezers in the restaurant. Then he made thoughtful recommendations. Not just, ""this is good."" He explained the ingredients and how things were prepared. He showed us our food before putting it in the to go bag, and gave us a sample of every sauce, including a pairing recommendation for the white BBQ sauce and turkey or chicken. 

Food is great! I'm from the South, Jacksonville, FL. I know good collard greens and Mac-n-cheese. The collards were amazing, just the right amount of spice. The Mac-n-cheese met all the expectations he had set and you could definitely tell the five cheeses were in there. 

Great service and food. Even if he hadn't invited us to come back, we will return because of this fantastic experience.",5.0,2,2

"I hate leaving bad reviews but unfortunately this place deserves it. Let's start with the burgers...  awfully dry and tasteless. The bacon had a funny taste and there wasn't enough cheese on the burger to augment the dryness. My fiancé and I both ordered our burgers medium but they were both pretty well done, dry and tasteless. We ordered parmesan garlic fries. Although a large portion, all it had was salt pepper and what looked like store bought powder parmesan cheese. Not a single piece of garlic or even garlic powder. The fries came out almost 15 minutes after our burgers.

The only good things about the place was the shrimp and crab bisque and the $1oysters. Our waitress didn't even tell us the specials. We had no idea that they had $1 oysters all day on Sunday until I walked up to see the specials board. The oysters were fresh and shucked well but she must have forgot to serve us the horseradish and vinegar to accompany the oysters. Not only was the food awful but the service wasn't great either. I ordered my burger bunless but of course it can on the bun and my fiancé asked for lettuce tomato and onion which never came to the table. Not once did she come to check on us to see how everything was. 

Even though we love fresh oysters we will never come back to this place after an experience like this. On to the next. The only reason for the 2 stars was the soup and the oysters, if not for that I would have given 1 star. Very disappointing.",2.0,0,0

"I went there last week for an early dinner.  The place struck me as peculiar looking upon arrival - the tables and chairs look like a wedding banquet hall furnishing, and the murals and chandeliers make me think of suburban Italianate houses - but before too long I was immersed in my food, wine, and the good company of my dining partner.  The service that a lot of people seem to think of as ""rushed"" is, i think, just hyper-attentive.  The place was packed before too long and the atmosphere was close and boisterous, in a good way.  The fennel and radicchio salad seemed roughly cut and thus a little tough, but the dressing was perfectly balanced.  It was a chewy delight to eat.  The pasta with rabbit ragu was savory, not at all greasy.  I was pleasantly surprised by this place and would go back.  It was also surprisingly affordable for the quality of the food.",3.0,1,2

"This review would honestly be a 5, but I have a small issue with the staff that seems to only consist of teenagers. The food tastes great and the prices aren't too shabby. But the service isn't the best. For instance, this evening we came in for ice cream and Fries. My hot fudge sundae came with barely any hot fudge at all. When I asked about it they said they were out of fudge because they forgot to heat up more. They didn't offer to fix it or anything. And the whole only staffing teens is bad for the bottom line of the management too. In the 45 minutes we were there, I saw the back of house staff give away maybe 40-50 dollars worth of food to their friends and coworkers who weren't working. They were constantly stopping work to chat with their buddies on the customer side of the counter. And the custard station was a huge, unorganized looking mess. I think there should be an older, more mature staff member here at all times. I feel like it would be better for business.",3.0,1,0

"Short review: If you want to go somewhere w/ a nice patio and a long line for drinks, come here, also convenient if you live in the neighborhood. It is what it is.

Slightly longer review: I live close-by and my friend and his new band were playing there on a Friday night, so I was looking forward to a leisurely and pleasant evening, which it was...but JAYSIS this place kind of blows.

One, no exaggeration, 10 minutes to get a drink- and I was sitting at the bar. The bartender did that thing where they work right in front of you but choose to ignore you, even though you're holding cash/card with a smile. I understand you're busy and here's a quick remedy: say, ""I'll be right with you."" That's all it takes. On top of that, the bartender (same guy from a few posts down) has got the driest sense of humor, which I can appreciate, but most times he came off as rude. And he was SLOW. The rule of the restaurant business is if you're busy, then work and move that much faster.

I would come back if my friend's band was playing again, otherwise nah.",2.0,0,2
"I absolutely love this place. The food is good, not the best, but very good. Some items, like the iceberg wedge, ARE as good as it gets, and the service is definitely top-notch. Crystal is one of the funniest waitresses of all time. 

The sandwiches here are quite commonly ordered, and quite good. The meatloaf sandwich, which my counterpart ordered recently, was enough for at least 2 meals, so keep that in mind if you go that direction when ordering. The salads are pretty darn good; I usually order the dinner salad with salmon. 

The dinners come with great sides, and there are about 20 or more to choose from, including the wedge, as well as a great baked potato. 

The brunch...fabulous. Get up and take the family or your hungover friends. It's one of the best places to eat breakfast in town.

The bar is also a wonderful feature, and is a great place to belly up on a rainy day or cold, winter afternoon to watch a game or two. It usually does not get too crowded, so getting there and finding your spot should not be an issue. If you've got the kids, the restaurant side is completely family friendly.

The ambiance is that of a hole in the wall with unique decor, but I don't say that in a bad way at all..it makes the place super special and one of a kind.

To Whom it may concern
I have worked on and looked at Harry & Scott Merkle's 2016 Dodge Journey several times for them during their ownership, as a personal favor to them for all the business they have sent me through out the years.Scott came to me when he first purchased this vehicle back in September of 2018 complaining that there was a slight noise in the right rear and a slight vibration in the rear when he went 50mph or more . He stated that the dealership stated they could not duplicate and it was normal for an AWD vehicle. I drove the vehicle and could totally duplicate what Scott was telling me. I suggested he take the vehicle back, and demand they return it and put him into something else. He came back to me in November of 2018 stating he made several attempts to get the car taken back but the salesman kept coming back saying all they could do was trade it in, he was upset because he claimed the vibration in the rear was worse, the noise in the right rear was louder, and his front and rear bumpers kept popping loose. I put the vehicle up on the lift and told him immediately that their was undercarriage damage to the vehicle, and it appears to have been in an accident and repaired poorly. The right rear noise was a wheel bearing noise, it wasn't bad at the time just a little noisy. Scott later called me and told me that the dealership continues to tell him they will help him and all they want to do is trade the vehicle in. He is now telling me that the wheel bearing finally went and he was forced to have it repaired, the front
FRONT AIR DEFLECTOR FLEW OFF on the HIGHWAY, the door locks stopped working and had to be repaired, the BUMPERS FRONT & REAR continue to pop apart , and now the vehicle vibrates to bad at highway speeds that it wanders. He also states the HOOD RANDOMLY UNLATCHES , THIS COULD HAPPEN @ HIGHWAY SPEEDS CAUSING A MAJOR ACCIDENT!  MY PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT  this vehicle is not ABDICATE . I told him in my own professional advise that the vehicle is unsafe to drive and he should DEMAND THE DEALERSHIP INVOLVED TO TAKE THE CAR BACK  either REFUND HIM or RED CARPET MR MERKEL INTO SOMETHING MORE DESIRABLE WITHOUT HASSLE OR PENALIZING HIM !! 
This vehicle was in a major accident and should have never been sold. This Vehicle HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VISUAL BODY DAMAGE  & WHAT KIND OF IDIOT WOULD PUSH THIS DISASTERIS VEHICLE ON A HONEST CONSUMER ! If the dealership had checked this vehicle out before selling it to him they would have known this,client stated they were putting him into a brand new one, and His current vehicle came off the truck and they said they could do a better deal on it for him and it was a better model, which from what he says it is. My ASSESSMENT   they cleaned it up and sent him on his way IGNORING Scott Merkle's  2016 Dodge Journey's MAJOR ISSUES  after test driving it.My ASSESSMENT they cleaned   it up and sent him on his way IGNORING Scott Merkle's2016 Dodge Journey's MAJOR ISSUES  after test driving it.My ASSESSMENT   they cleanedit up and sent him on his way IGNORING Scott Merkle's2016 Dodge Journey's MAJOR ISSUES  after test driving it.This vehicle as I have stated was in a majoraccident to cause undercarriage damage.

"We came to Ohana for a Sunday brunch. We arrived around 9:30 and fortunately it wasn't too crowded yet. I started with coffee with coconut creamer, which was tasty. We ordered the breakfast burrito with egg whites and turkey bacon and the popover meal with macadamia nut sauce. After the waitress left, I wanted the pancakes instead of the popovers, so hubs went inside and asked if she could change the order. She said no problem, she hadn't even put it in yet. We waited...and waited...AND WAITED for our food. Our server told us our food would be out soon, then 10 minutes later said 5 more minutes. 5 minutes passed, no food. Then people next to us got their meal, and they didn't even sit down until AFTER we ordered. They even commented to the waitress that they felt bad they got our food before us. Finally, our meal came out about 5 minutes after that. Go figure....we got the popovers, not the pancakes. So much for ""sure no problem, I didn't even put in the order yet."" The food was very good...the popovers were really tasty, as was the macadamia nut sauce (which I'm glad we ordered on the side because it was super sweet). The side of an egg seemed unnecessary. The quinoa breakfast wrap was huge with mostly greens. The quinoa salad had a lot of flavor and the flavor of the turkey bacon was almost entirely masked, so I wouldn't recommend that add-on (our waitress did). Overall, the meal was good. It was a nice healthy brunch and I appreciate the ability to order a hearty meal of all organic ingredients that won't break the calorie bank. But the service was truly lacking. All the employees were super nice, but the wait for our food (without any offer to comp something, anything) and the fact that we ended up getting the popovers rather than the pancakes were real disappointments. I would return, but only if I have my patience cap on.

"BAD NEWS. A friend used Savvi for their wedding recently and regretted it. The various locations could not seem to coordinate our info. The store is tiny and the quality of materials was a ""D+"" with some bad tailoring thrown in.  For $200, we expected better--but remember this is a mass-market mall formalwear store, so you get what you might expect.  The ONLY positive is that they are open longer hours as they are in a mall.  

Stallone's Formal Wear nearby was much better quality and service the last time we needed a wedding rental.  

I cannot recommend Savvi. 

Negatives: 
- Quality of materials
- Measurement errors (shirt too short)
- Confusion between stores
- Not a deal ($200)
- Galleria parking can be nuts

"Stumbled across this place one day on a whim after reading some other reviews on Yelp. Super glad we came. Amazing seaafood paella. Wish they offered their lunch menu on the weekends during lunch though. Their chimichuri sandwich was incredible.

I don't recommend bringing kids, unless they're a fan of peruvian food, as there is no kids menu.",5.0,2,2

We love coming here on Saturdays when we do our grocery shopping at the Market. I get a spicy sausage with grilled peppers and onions and mustard. Last week we also tried the onion rings and fried zucchini. Seating can be pretty limited so we are always staking out a table while we are in line. I'd definitely recommend this as one of the better sit down options at the Market,5.0,2,2

We are pretty patient people. Even for laid back New Orleans this service couldn't get any slower. It took 30 minutes just to order our food.

"Tldr: Frozen is a mirror image of Ice Land in a similar area but for $1.50 more. 

Food! Cause its the most important: my friend and I split the Cookie on call or oreo rolled ice cream (which I would recommend making the cost only ~$3.50/person) and were not disappointed!! The ice cream was very flavorful and our toppings of chocolate chips and chocolate syrup made for chocolatey goodness!! 

Environment: Frozen felt a little more cramped than ice land and it wasn't very packed when I went. The tables were very clean and they had top 40 music in the background. Sadly, they didn't have any board games or couches to make the place into a relaxing one =/. I believe they are open a little bit longer than ice land though!!

"My roommate told me this place opened up in Lakeview which is close to where we live.  I got off of work and was looking forward to eating a good poke bowl and thought I would give this place a shot. It turned out to be my first mistake. There was literally no one when I walked in. The place looks very presentable and is very nice looking.  It was very clean and modern inside. I had high expectations. I order a custom bowl with brown rice/spring mix, with my 3 protein choices being  spicy tuna, yellow tail and crawfish.  I had it with a Lime Sriracha  sauce with all the veggies and chili sauce with the ponzu sauce mixed in. My second mistake was not eating the bowl inside.  I took it to go.  I certainly would have mentioned to them the issue I had which brings me to my next complaint. The rice on first bite looked odd, like it either was undercooked or too cooked to the point it was dried out.  I suspect they didn't add enough water for the brown rice.  It was practically inedible.  I couldn't chew it it was so hard.  Imagine chewing rice that has the consistency of a hard seed.  That was my experience.  It was terrible.  The proteins look low grade, especially the yellow fin.  I will never go back and I don't recommend anyone else does either.  If you want good poke in the Lakeview/Metairie area just make the drive to Poke Loa or to Lemon Shark.  It is worth it, trust me.  The other reviewers who complained about the rice are telling the truth.  If I could give this place zero stars I would.",1.0,0,1
The food is really good. Which I would of gave 4 star. But waiter waited way too long for one beer and a mimosa. $7.50 for an 8 ounce Victory Golden Monkey is outrageous.  Mimosa came in a a small wine glass $6.50.  Foods good but don't drink there.,3.0,1,2

"My last visit was 25 years ago and I wish I never went back so I could have kept those good memories of Steak Dianne and Bananas Foster intact.

Instead I dropped $225 on a very mediocre, tasteless dinner.  The salad was awful with off tasting lettuce, blue cheese dressing with no discernible blue cheese, and deep fried croutons that tasted of old oil.  The seafood sampler was sparse with 2 briny oysters, 2 metallic clams, 2 fairly large shrimp, and a small dollop of crab.  The soups were old school and heavy.  Cream of Crab and Snapper were just ok and likely came from a frozen soup base.  The fillets were way under seasoned.  They had no taste.  Cooked to proper temperature, but really no sear.  The twice baked potato was awful.  A glue like substance in an under cooked potato shell.  It was nicely browned on top.  The Bananas Foster looked really good and the presentation was great. 

This place reminds me of a restaurant past its prime featured on a Kitchen Nightmare.  I could see Chef Ramsey yelling about the quality of the food and imagine they have fallen into bad habits and short cuts.  Bottom line is that there are dozens of better places to get a steak at a similar price point.",2.0,0,0

"I would leave zero stars if I could.

1. I would also recommend that consumers either encourage online retailers to avoid using UPS, or if possible to shop at a local store instead. In our case we ended up having to visit Best Buy in person anyhow. 

2. Extremely poor customer service. No way to contact the local UPS office directly via telephone. New drivers not trained to find locations appropriately. I could go on and on but this post is already too long.

3. When the UPS driver cannot find the address there is no place for him/her to state that he/she could not find the address. This causes the UPS driver to make up some other excuse such as ""The receiver was not available at the time of delivery"" or ""the address is incorrect.""

Lie may be a strong word but in this case, unfortunately, it is the truth. 

We never received a phone call on any of the supposed delivery dates and we know the UPS driver was never at our location at the times he stated ""the receiver was not available at the time of delivery"".

4. Poor care of item to be delivered. The box we finally received a week late had damge in several places. (see photos)

5. When an order is cancelled with the online store from whom the item was purchased (in this case Best Buy) AND cancelled with UPS, the item is still delivered and it is the buyers' responsibility to return the item to receive an immediate refund or decline the item from the UPS delivery driver. If the driver does a ""drop and run"" you have no choice but to return the item to a local store, if there is one.",1.0,0,0

"I'm so excited to have found such a fun restaurant nearby. The decor is very 50's diner/soda jerk --which is a lot of fun. They play old fashioned piano tunes to complement the atmosphere. The bricked Lebanon street mixed with the old timely atmosphere of Dr. Jazz's was a blast from the past.

The food is pretty good. I got the Italian beef with mild peppers. The peppers were so good (but hot) and the Italian beef was pretty good. The beef fell apart very easily and made it hard to eat but the soft, pillowy, perfect sandwich bun made up for that. The french fries were great and possibly made in house. It was worth the $10.99 to me.

The service was prompt and friendly. Definitely no complaints there.

The ice cream was awesome! I shared the chocolate ice cream with whipped cream and a huge brownie (forgot what it was called on the menu) for $6.99 with my boyfriend. It was plenty to share and we couldn't finish it all.

Indoor seating is either at the bar or at counters along the perimeter of the small room.  It can get quite noisy when it's crowded- but it has a fun vibe.  Outside there are 3 or 4 tables.  We opted to sit outside, despite it being quite windy, because we wanted to enjoy the view and the sea air.

The reason for 3 stars.  
I wish they would hire more staff for the gun counter,  I was in about a week ago with a friend and waited almost 30 minutes to look and buy a rifle.  I know it is hard to anticipate a crowed but it was 10 am on a Tuesday.  
I also think that they are slightly over priced.  Expect to pay $50-$75 more for a gun.  This estimate is based on what other local shops are selling for and not online prices.

"If you just want one corn dog they charge you more than someone who wants two or three.  That's why I didn't buy a corn dog.

My reply to the message form the owner:

I get it.  You charge a 33.3% surcharge on persons who only order one corn dog.  That's one dollar and sixty-seven cents. $1.67--Surely that amount far exceeds your food cost, including the stick, for said single corn dog. 

And therefore, by your thinking, pizzerias should charge less per slice if you buy two or three rather than one.

And Five Guys--those fools!--they should be charging less per burger when you buy two instead of one, and even less if you buy three.

And why do I have the feeling that that positive feedback you've been getting comes from groups of persons ordering multiple corn dogs, not from individuals such as myself who just want to try one. 

And thank you for the corn dog lesson.  

But am I to understand that you buy pre-made hot dogs, like those sold in supermarkets?  And you don't even mill your own cornmeal?   

And it's so good of you to prepare your fancy corn dogs to order when you could simply batch them out and stick 'em under a heat lamp. You really go that extra mile in the pursuit of fanciness!

There were only a few reviews but all good. Looked at the pics, looked good. Prices looked good. So I made a decision to make an appointment and so glad I did. I went in the morning on a week day and the place was exactly as pictured. The feeling was tranquil. There was only one other person there that she was working on but she greeted me graciously, apologized and asked me if I would mind waiting for 30 minutes before she got started on me. The lounge area was comfortable and clean like the rest of the shop. When I sat in her chair for the consultation, we further discussed what I thought I wanted (a brief conversation took place over the phone when I booked the appointment). I had cut my locs the previous year and wasn't happy with hair. I had a lot of ideas about style and color but didn't know how to narrow it down. She listened and shared a few 'realistic' options and what it would involve. While she was working she explained what she was doing so I could do it at home. It didn't take long at all!

"This is place is a gem located in the heart of a sleepy New Orleans neighborhood.   We arrived in the middle of storm, so when we got there it was as if we had just arrived at home.  We were welcomed in by some of the friendliest people I've ever met.

We opened up with some pan fried mac n' cheese.  Sooo good, this can be a meal in itself.  We could not stop raving about how good this ""small plate"" was.  Can I try making this at home?  This is not your normal mac n' cheese.  Can I come back just for this?  Absolutely!

We also ordered the redneck brisket and the mixed grill (a daily selcetion of smoked suasages).  The brisket was a sandwich accompanied by homemade sweet pickles and potato chips.  I ordered the ""dill"" chips and boy they were a good match for a my sandwich.  The mixed grill came with boudin, Italian, lil' smokies.  Each came with their own accoutrements and these selections change daily.  Their lil' smokies served with BBQ sauce were the best in this selection.

There is also a good selection of local N.O. beers and housemade drinks.  The staff is friendly and very eager to help with dinner choices.  It was very clear that they work as a team as we were served by at least three different staff members.  

Lastly, there was a variety of homemade pies.  We decided on the key lime pie (even though we were stuffed, we went big).  More like a key lime cheesecake, it was awesome.  Like Joey Chestnut on the 4th of July, we found the will to finish that bad boy.",4.0,2,2

"Okay, my first review was in my early Yelping days and I know it did no justice for this place, although as you can see from the other Yelp reviews, this place has it's fanbase. I'm just another fan dropping a review or....""revamped"" review in my case, and just letting the Yelpdom know.....The quality of the food you get here for the price is ""Asinine"" some would even say ""Bananas"" but all in the best of ways. Here we go..

The Top Deck Restaurant is home to the $4.99 Steak and Eggs for Breakfast, $4.99 Steak and Fries for Dinner and the ever popular.......(drumroll now) $5.99 Prime Rib dinner! And I know some may be apprehensive to trying steak and prime rib dinners for such a low cost. But let me tell you, you would be shocked at the quality and the deliciousness that you get from here. And did I mention the cost!

They have other menu items here as well as to not just highlight what they seem to already have on their building (the steaks) the menu items range from..
Chicken Dinners, Salads, Burritos, Pastas, Sandwiches, Soups, Burgers ect. This place has your general ""Diner"" style motif going on here. 

The service here is decent, it could vary depending on who you get, some of the waiters and waitresses seem like they get annoyed very easy. But I say ""suck it up"" with some of the best prices around you know you're going to get a lot of business. I usually leave my tips according to my service. I usually visit at least twice a day on my stays in Reno so I guess they get okay tips from me. The Prime Rib dinner honestly is the only thing I've ordered from here. Compared to big chain restaurants and my fav Prime Rib spot here in Nor Cal Mac's Ol House. This place holds its ground as a solid steakhouse.

When you get the Prime Rib dinner it comes with the soup of the day which usually varies between..

Split Pea
Clam Chowder
Chicken Noodle

You could have French Fries or Mashed Potatos for your side or even mixed veggies if you want to lay easy on the carbs. 

In closing, ""All hands on Deck"" all in the front, all in the back just like that! This is a place you ""Must"" visit when you are out here in Reno. I always end up meeting cool people in here and overall just enjoying the food here. This place is the true star of the Club Cal Neva, and I don't see this place losing it's shine anytime soon.

The cuisine is luscious-from the simple truffle tater tots (addicting), to the beautiful octopus, unique chicken feet with an amazing sauce, very flavorful wagyu beef burger, to Amish chicken (succulent).  
The red leather booths and the low lighting create almost a fantasy world... where you languish and sip on exquisite cocktails, enjoy beautiful food, and totally relax!

The portions are huge and the two dollar surcharge to share is a deal.  We would return, but our appetite would have to be greater.",3.0,1,1

"We went on Halloween night.  They were busy but we only had to wait 20 minutes before we were seated.  We went for the BBQ Shrimp and man it was sooo good!!  We had it as an appetizer.  I would have gave them higher marks but they ran out of fried oysters and we were looking forward to them.  I ordered fried soft shell crab and it was just ok but my friend got the fried shrimp and they were good and they gave a lot on the order
Go for the BBQ Shrimp and get dirty while you enjoy them!",3.0,1,1

"Want a burrito so big you can't finish for under $10, well this is your spot! The best way to describe Juan's would be delicious, trendy, reasonable, and quick. 

There are so many options for tacos, burritos, etc. and ALL are so good! I was in NOLA for three days and came two of the three days to eat here! There are a ton of great drink options as well.

The green salsa is AMAZING. I also highly recommend the guac!

Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for a delicious, quick reasonable option!",5.0,2,2

He was able to help us customize our tour as we went and took us to an awesome old bar in the mountains. He even dropped us off at a restaurant he recommended in Santa Barbara afterwards!

Went for our 1st time. We tried scotched eggs which are really good. My son got a Reuben which was super yummy. My husband got Irish stew which was super salty for our liking and needed chunks of beef not shredded. I got Kerry lamb and mashed potatoes. Lamb cooked perfect but was marinated in vinegar and too much after a few bites. My sides were mashed potatoes and cheese broccoli cassarole both very boring and needs flavor.,2.0,0,1
"I had lunch at Cafe Bosna on a Saturday. There was no wait to be seated, but it did take 15-20 mins to receive our food once we ordered. The wait time wasn't terrible by any means, but the food didn't really justify the wait. I ordered the Polish Sausage Plate and requested mashed potatoes rather than rice. The dish also came with a side salad and pita bread. Though the dish was tasty, it left me with the impression that I could get the same dish and same quality of food at any other venue that offers this type of cuisine. Cafe Bosna is worth trying, but don't expect a mind-blowing experience.",3.0,1,0
"A friend and I decided to come to Murrieta's for lunch today after she raved about a chicken salad she had on a previous visit.  I am always up for Mexican food - there's something about cheese and rice and beans and salsa that I just can't resist.  We were seated quickly and our server brought out housemade tortilla chips with two different kinds of salsa.  The spicy salsa was a bit too hot for my gringo tastes, but the mild was just right and very fresh with lots of ripe tomato, onion and cilantro.  I damn near had to sit on my hands to keep from eating them all before our food came.  I ordered a lunch size or ""back to work"" pomegranate margarita.  It had quite a kick of tequila, but was a little deficient in the taste department.  I had a hard time finding the pomegranate flavor.  I ordered the enchilada lunch special and it came with two chicken enchiladas, rice, and beans.  It was a good deal at around $9 and it tasted good as well.  I loved the rice and finished almost all of it.  The enchiladas were pretty large and I ended up taking one enchilada home for later.  But, what really impressed me about Murrieta's was the server had overhead my friend saying she was going to buy lunch for my birthday.  (My birthday was on May 20th, but conflicting schedules didn't allow for us to celebrate until today).  Anyways, our server came out with a bowl of deep fried vanilla ice cream in a cinnamon sugar dusted tortilla bowl loaded with fluffy, whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles and a lit birthday candle!  They also brought out a huge sombrero for me to wear as they sang Happy Birthday :)  Such a sweet, thoughtful gesture (even though my birthday had already passed). I can't wait to come back to Murrieta's to try more of the great food and enjoy the fantastic service.",4.0,2,2
"I wanted to love this place so much but was so disappointed. Came here with a group of friends for dinner. Ambiance is great and so is location. Staff is very attentive and polite. However the food was such a disappointment. In a group of 9 people more than half had to send the food back for being incorrect. The drinks were good and the server was great. He didn't charge us for the food we sent back and they replaced it but it was still sub par. The rib eye I ordered cause I saw
Good reviews and pics on it but it was nothing to brag about. No seasoning on it and it seems like it was cooked in an oven and grill marks added. Sushi was disappointing as well. My friend ordered blue cheese crusted filet and it came out without the blue cheese. The Mac and cheese was good but was left out too long before being served to us. The Brussels were good along with the crab dip. Im hoping jt was just an off night and would give it a chance again due to the servers and great service but for the price I expect better quality food.",2.0,0,1

"Fleming's is wonderful!  Is it perfect?  No.  But, considering the prices you'll pay, I think it should be.  Here are what I think needs improving:

*  Noise level.  At peak dinner hours, the din is so loud you almost have to yell at your dining companion just to converse.  Fleming's needs to install some sound-absorbing fabric or something.  It's ridiculously loud.  I see that several other Yelpers have commented upon this.

*  Beware of ""bone-in filet mignon.""  (Holiday menu)  This isn't a tenderloin with the bone; it's actually 1/2 a Porterhouse.  So, no, it's not all filet-tender.  (Mine had a bite of gristle/fat that was really tough.)  

*  Lobster bisque with sherry is delicious, however the sole piece of lobster meat in the bowl is rubbery claw meat.  For the prices you'll pay at Fleming's, they should include some tail meat in the soup.

That's it.  All relatively minor.  The service is impeccable, and honestly I could eat their bread and alcohol-infused butters all day long.",4.0,2,1
"I tried this for the first time based on My old friend Yelp! 

The food is really good and there is a fair selection too. I was not a fan of the interior security cameras though-I don't know why they would need to video customers eating.

"I'm generally a fan of Steak 'n Shake. I mean, you know what to expect from them - cheap food that's decent enough for the price (and Frisco Melt tasty madness!). That being said, this location has taken a fairly sharp fall from grace of late.

The service ranges from mediocre to piss-poor. I'm generally very soft on servers as I've worked in the industry before. I know that they're, in all likelihood, drastically understaffed at all hours here. That being said, the place is always dirty and for the love God, if you order online it doesn't make a single bit of difference. They're cooking it when you get there.

What's worse is it's also always jammed pack with the worst kind of douchebags who actually have no sympathy and worse yet, a sense of the surrounding environment. It's a fairly intolerable combo.

When it boils down to it, I have but one piece of advice for this location - if there's a seat at the counter, grab it! It's absolutely the one spot you're guaranteed some solid response time and you can usually drown out the background noise when you bite in steakburgery tastieness. Other locations are probably a better bet, though.",2.0,0,0

"If it was an option, i wouldnt give this place ONE star. Unfortunately; i thought this would be an okay place to stay cause it had decent reviews on Expedia atleast. 
Lets start with checking in, that was fine. i arrived late, 4 am, but the guy was super nice and gave me a late check out time (1pm). 

Then 8 am comes and i am woke up by a fire alarm, and the speaker saying to exit immediately through the stairwell. about 20 of us run through there, only to come outside and find 3 employees smoking who had no idea what was going on, and then said it was a false alarm! Which would be fine, until multiple people said this kept happening the last few days.
Well i only had about 3.5 hours of sleep. There was no hot water. My door to the balcony did not open at all, the air conditioner would not cool the room, i finally decided to lay down and try to go back to sleep, BUT THE BLINDS DONT CLOSE EITHER, TRIED EVERYTHING....then housekeeping next door was banging around so much. And LOUD bangs, loud enough my room shook three times, my hangers fell off, my water fell odd the side table. you could actually feel that vibration so hard. Not to mention theres ants in the bathroom floor which seems like an odd place. 

I finally went down to the desk with my things, and the girl with blonde hair and long fake eyelashes was so rude because i said ""what is this sh!t"" and she yelled right back at me, told me i couldn't get a refund, and pretended a fire alarm never went off. Literally acted like i was lying and like she had no clue that happened even though there was over 20 of us running like crazy out of the building. 

Idk if its true she can't refund me, and Expedia has to do it, but im so upset and i still have a 17 hour drive to do. Ive never took the time to write a review on anything, and ive had some awful stays but usually understanding. This property is a joke.",1.0,0,0

"I've never written a review on here, and it's a shame that my first has to be about such a nasty experience. I'm giving two stars only because this is the only time I've ever witnessed this after having good experiences on my other visits, and I'm hoping this was just a fluke. 

I have been going to this store for ice cream for a year or so now and have always had a pleasant experience. The employees have always been nice and helpful, and I never have a problem getting the ice cream I want. The ice cream is actually pretty darn tasty - much better than the yogurt place across the street. 

About a week or so ago I wanted to buy some chocolates for a close friend and thought I might try visiting the store - I had always seen all kinds of sweet treats in the case and they looked pretty good, but I never had a reason to buy any. So one day I took an early lunch and walked into the store, and while I was looking around I watched one of the employees, an older woman who was not terribly pleasant to the coworkers there at the time, handling chocolates with her bare hands. 

Now I'm no health inspector, but I would assume from my experiences and just plain ol' common sense that handling food in a public setting with bare hands is a BIG health code violation. 

Needless to say, my total disgust sent me flying out of the store (I wondered if anyone there noticed my abrupt exit) and quickly back to my office. I was so turned off by the thought of her germy hands on the food I couldn't even bring myself to buy chocolates somewhere else. I know wearing those gloves is a pain - I worked in the food industry in college and know how cumbersome they can be - but it's food safety 101. 

I've been back to the store one time since then for ice cream and had a good experience, but I was sure to avoid the chocolate counter and that woman like the plague. 

So visit the store, let someone other than that woman serve you, and don't buy chocolates.",2.0,0,0

The Saki page has several offerings, but on both visits I just ordered the large with 2 shot glasses for my friend and I.  Lunch specials are around $7 and you get soup, crab Rangoon, and your main.

i have ordered the wrong coffee sooo many times and i have never ever been met with any resistance to remaking it on the house. we weren't about to pay 24$ for two coffees. 

i always end up getting coffee from here when i'm in the area since there are so few decent coffee joints around here in comparison to the Pacific Northwest, but these people will never, ever receive anymore of my money. should have just went the extra distance to Savaya. better service and BETTER ROASTED COFFEE. do yourself a favor, and go indulge in the positive vibrations of Savaya instead of a place that's filled with lots of RAGE. guess their name should have given that away from the beginning.",1.0,0,0

"Back in town to watch the Raiders and Saints play.  After crossing the country and settling in our hotel, we were hungry and I had remembered eating here on my last visit and loving it.  Being that it was in walking distance, we headed straight there.

My friend and I just made up a party of two.  We had another group of friends with us, but they were a good 30 minutes behind us and we weren't waiting.

It was mid-afternoon, so there weren't a lot of people in there yet, but the first thing that hit me was the smell.  Maybe I was just hungry, but it smelled so damn good in there!  We took one of the two-seater tables along the wall and were immediately handed our menus.  Because everything looked so good, we were having trouble deciding.  Our waitress (very friendly, by the way) suggested ""Coop's Taste Plate"" - essentially a sampler plate of their signature items.  It had seafood gumbo, shrimp creole, Cajun fried chicken, red beans and rice with sausage, and jambalaya.  For the record, both my friend and I agreed that this was the best meal that we had in New Orleans.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  I won't go into descriptions of everything because I don't want to drool on my keyboard here, but believe me, this is a must stop for the food!

We were basking in our glow and washing our meal down with the suggested Abita (beer) pairing for our food when our friends arrived.  There are two picnic style benches that they were directed to with one being occupied by a couple that was seated a few minutes earlier.  What they failed to realize was that they were directed to sit at the SAME bench as the couple, with the intent of maximizing space.  Not a big deal (ever eat at Carnegie Deli in NYC?).  But not realizing the intended space for their group, they sat down at the other (unoccupied) table.  Immediately, the individual behind the bar, abruptly corrected them and moved them to the intended table.  Again, not a big deal, but the condescending and snide remarks that accompanied that correction -even AFTER they were seated in the intended table- were unnecessary.  I will just say this:  I'm glad my friends were engaged in conversation and weren't even paying attention to you, because had they heard what you said, they would have been MORE than happy to provide you their thoughts.  At that point, I would have had to order popcorn to fully enjoy the exchange. 

So I guess I saw what most of the Yelpers are talking about here: Great food, but ugly attitudes.  What happened to Southern hospitality?  The truth is, even though we were wearing our Raiders gear EVERYWHERE throughout New Orleans, we were treated incredibly kindly by everyone for our entire trip - even our waitress at Coop's Place, she was awesome!  But what is the deal with that miserable person behind the bar?  Better question:  What do you stand to gain by espousing such toxicity?  Congratulations, you were the nastiest person we met in New Orleans - even nastier than the druggie on the street that approached us and asked, ""Ya'll been robbed yet?""

Do with that what you will, Yelpers.  Me, I'll still go back.  The food is amazing, and even though misery loves company, I recognize that and don't let the miserable get to me.",4.0,2,2

They rescue cats (lions, tigers, servals, Jaguars, leopards, bobcats and more) from homes, zoos, circuses etc.  and give them the best retirement home with space, enrichment, and even vacations.  Medical care is available as needed and the cats are pampered.  However, they are wild animals so no touching.  Big Cat Rescue also rehabs bobcats that are lost from their moms, hit by a car, or wander into the wrong places.  They reinforce wild instincts and heal wounds and then set them free if they show they can survive.  The tours are informative and some of the cats love the attention.  Some, however, could care less about the tourists.  Take a tour!   Great place.  Educational fun.",5.0,2,2

"Chef John Besh keeps knocking it out of the park.  Since arriving in New Orleans 6 months ago, I've eaten at four of his restaurants and have been amazed at each one.  So, when it came time to choose a restaurant to celebrate my birthday, I chose another one of his establishments, Lüke.  Service was excellent and helpful.  Wait staff was very knowledgable of the menu.  Although I have always hated brussels sprouts, he convinced me to try the appetizer of crispy brussels sprouts with honey, toasted almonds, progress milk and barn cheese. I hate them no longer.  They were amazing.  For an entreé, I had the roast duck with crispy rice, duck confit and grilled figs. Be warned that the duck is served very rare, which I like but some may not.  My wife had pan seared drum with roasted vegetables, almonds, brown butter and lump crabmeat.  They also serve it blackened (which should be outlawed) or grilled, but the traditional pan-seared is the best.  I remain a huge fan and can't wait to try his other restaurants.",5.0,2,2

 The caesar salad was homemade. You could tell because the dressing had that slightly sardine taste to it. It is not a negative it is a sign of freshness. A crowd favorite was the turkey burger. It was nice and moist unlike some of the turkey burgers I have had.

"I wish there was no star rating. Because that's what this place deserves. Parking is awful, even if you pay for a spot, other tenants tend to take your spot and you are stuck calling the main office and then they tell you to park in a different parking space (now you're taking the spot of someone else).  ALSO, they gave a permit for my parking spot to someone else! For some reason, without my consent or knowing, gave another tenant my parking spot for free while I was still paying for it and living there trying to use my own parking spot. They add additional charges wherever they can. At the end it's not worth fighting the additional 25.00 here and there and I ended up just paying them. Just counting the days till my lease was up. I was charged $25 for a missing gate key, that I had turned in upon moving out. I handed in all of my keys and they put it in a little baggy and somehow they lost it, blaming me for losing it and therefore charging me. Ridiculous. Glad I won't be coming back to such a trashy place. The 20 year olds are jokes and all they do is socialize in the office and don't tend to the needs of the tenants. If you are a student that wants to party and meet others then this is the place for you. If you are a student as myself that really just wanted a clean place to live and study, then this is not the place for you....parties every weekend is not what I signed up for.
Drugs and alcohol are always welcomed at Beach City and if that's your thing then this is the perfect place to live for you. I won't be renewing my lease, done giving them extra money. BTW there is a girl in the front office named Ava with a face that will intimidate you by just asking a question. She was no joke, scary.",1.0,0,0

The first time when I contacted skyline limousine to ask about the status of the car, they said they could not contact the driver and they thought that he had been working late and might have fallen asleep. Eventually through a series of back-and-forth phone calls, about 15 minutes later, they said they could have someone out to us in 20 minutes. The person I spoke to was very combative and was not trying to help the situation at all,  in fact it felt like he was trying to offer excuses as to why it happened (I just got in the office and am just looking into this now). He was also very rude and hung up on my wife several times.  We ended up catching an Uber, which are really hard to get due to the driver shortage right now, that showed up within a couple minutes, which allowed us to barely make our flight as it was boarding. Had we waited for this car to ""show up"" of which I had my doubts anyway, we would have missed our flight and connecting flight home, and I highly doubt this company would have done anything to try and resolve that.",1.0,0,0

The dessert, the ""pie"", is just the cherry on top. They have an insane selection of pies, cakes, and cheesecakes. I just enjoy being able to always try something different. Banana cream pie, key lime pie, raspberry coconut cake, chocolate caramel cake... This is a small fraction of the choices. 

And last but not least, I love the atmosphere here. In the summer, they have a gorgeous patio with a fountain and tons of flowers, even a cherry blossom tree. It's so peaceful. In the winter there's a cozy fireplace inside if you can snag a seat next to it!

On off-times, when the place is not reall populated (Sunday afternoon is a good time), i'll stop in just to watch some sports and have some food, and I have usually gotten great service then.  I've never actually partaken, but their Sunday Bloody Mary bar does look impressively stocked.

I was asked at the counter if I wanted to ""rent"" a SUNPASS for tolls and I declined.  I assumed any tolls I encountered I would simply pay as I went through.

Two Tolls showing up in a notice in my mail 2 months later - $ 1.87 and $ 1.62 for the 2 tolls and a $ 15' 'administration"" fee for each toll ""violation"" !!! = $ 32.49

I will write the FL States Attorney Generals office, the BBB and anyone else I can think of.

We learned about the entire history of New Orleans, from the first settlers to today, and about the everyday life that doesn't always make it into history books. Stella had to lead a large group through Mardi Gras crowds, and had to work really hard to make sure we had a good experience. She was great!

"Great food, sub par service.  Sat at the bar to eat.  Not one person behind the bar acknowledged my wife and I.  We didn't get our beverages until half way through eating our meal.  I had to get up and get my own sweetener for coffee.  It was very busy and everyone was hustling, which I can appreciate.  But it takes very little time to acknowledge the customer and make sure they have everything they need.  Had I paid after eating, I would not have left the 20% tip that I gave when ordering.  By far the worst service I have received during our trip to Nashville.",2.0,0,1

"I heard a lot of really good things about Dadeo on Whyte and so I wanted to try it.
I will say this to start off, their food is really good - so if you aren't a stickler for good service, this place will suit you well.
I found our waitress to be impatient, short and disinterested in us as customers. Only when we became noticeably irritated did she finally become relatively polite.
I don't know if she was new or just bad at her job but customer service is everything to me. I feel as though if one works hard for their money, they should feel good about where and who they give it to. I probably won't be back.",2.0,0,0
"THIS WAS THE BEST!! We rented a short bus for a friend's 30th birthday wine tasting day in Santa Ynez. Our driver, Francisco, arrived 5 minutes early, and was so friendly. He was super accommodating in taking all of the pictures we asked him to take of us in front of the bus - WHICH HAD THE NAME OF OUR EVENT ON THE SIDE!! He had an aux cord for our music, and helped each one of us on to and off of the bus at each stop. Francisco offered winery and lunch spot suggestions throughout the day - super helpful since none of us was very familiar with the area. 

Later in the day, Darrin, the owner, was SO nice and met up with us to make sure everything was going well. He also was plentiful with winery and food suggestions in the area. 

Overall, this was a seamless and PHENOMENALLY FUN day. Thanks, Jump on the School Bus! I can't wait to party with you again!!",5.0,2,2

"This place is by far the WORST BMW dealership to buy your car from. I would give them ZERO stars if I could.  I owned  eight BMW`s in my life, still own two and I was looking to get my 3rd one. Here is my experience:

I went to Bill Pearce on 04/10/17 for an advertised this 2011 BMW 535 Xdrive.The car was not available for a test drive, but I saw the exterior of the car and Carfax report on it. I agreed on $21,000 price on the first try and I was asked to put a $1,000 refundable (because of not being able to drive it)  deposit to reserve the car. I also signed a purchase order with them.  

Six days later, after the car went through their shop, I was able to test drive the car. During the test drive, I noticed that the front brakes were shaking when you brake, steering wheel is vibrating and the car had a unpleasant smell in it.  It did have new tires though. 

After thanking for the test drive, I mentioned about these safety related  issues to Mike and Steve (managers) while they were very comfortably watching TV  in the Customer Lounge. They told me in a very rude and cold way (in front of my 6 year old daughter) that ""We are not doing anything else on this car on this price. If you want you can take your money back and go!"". I must have distracted and interrupted their TV watching and I felt like my safety related concerns were irrelevant to them.

I think, it was a mistake to advertise and agree on a price with a customer on a car that was not even inspected. Why do you advertise and give a price on a car that is not ready to be sold?  

At the end, of course I asked for a refund and backed out with this kind of treatment . I should tell you that I truly felt very stressed and upset after leaving  this dealership, I would highly recommend avoiding this place and driving 100 miles to other BMW Dealerships for purchasing. 

 By the way, I saw the car next day on the web advertised $1,000 more than what it was advertised before. 

I would like to end my review with Robert Bosch`s famous quote  as a reminder to Bill Pearce BMW Sales  ""I Would Rather Lose Money Than Trust"".

Thanks for reading my review.",1.0,0,0
We had a bad experience due to what seems to be their online takeout system coupled with them taking too much business .  They have sent several messages to apologize. Good recovery.

"Baby Blues BBQ delivered well beyond my expectations! Everything I expected and more! I ordered the wings; oh so tender, smoky and fabulous. I also ordered the Mason Dixon; half rack of Memphis ribs and a chicken leg quarter which also came with two sides. I chose the greens and mac and cheese. EVERYTHING was plentiful and very flavorful! The only thing I'm pissed about is the fact that I just discovered this place. 

Now let's start with the wings, the wings the wings the wings. So delicious! I'm at a loss for words. Just try them for yourself. Over to the ribs; sooo tender and falling off of the bone. For some reason I was hesitant about ordering a half rack because I thought the portion would be small...Tah! Not the case at all juicy and crispy in all of the right places. Now the greens; You would think some old lady from down south is in the kitchen making them herself because she refused to share the family recipe. I pinched the crispy part of the leg quarter while it was hot and it was delicious. 

I ordered yesterday and will have the chicken and the rest of the ribs today. The best part is, I don't drive and didn't even have to leave my house for all of this greatness. I had it delivered and everything was piping hot and well packaged. 

Baby Blue's BBQ isn't holding any punches when it comes to their food. Looking forward to trying the fried green tomatoes and beef ribs next. Oh! I must add, the greens contain pork products but if you don't eat pork, they're still worth trying, just pretend you never noticed because that's probably one of the reasons why they're so darn good by the way. Most BBQ places tastes like takeout. Not this place! I have to dine in one day.",5.0,2,2

Food to try: chicken ( its white meat, fresh and delicious with fried rice or in a curry), pu pu platter gives a great sample of their apps.

"A bunch of dolts work here. Don't expect friendly service or a strong work ethic. I should have walked out the second I picked up their  vibes. 
Went in to get my passport pictures taken. The first employee didn't know if they offered that service. The second employee took my photo with her cell phone, didn't bother showing it to me until it had been cropped and I asked to see it. When I did see it, I asked if it could be redone (I don't expect perfection from a passport photo, mind you, but I will have this for 10 years)
They all just stood there, blinking at me.
""Hello...?"" I asked, not sure if anyone heard me.
The woman with the half-buzz cut stood there leaning behind the counter, arms folded. She nodded toward the woman with the cell phone as if that answered my question. The cell-phone woman acted like it was a huge inconvenience but took my photo again. She showed it to me. 
""Looks the same,"" she said, bored. 
I considered walking out. Maybe I should have. They didn't thank me for my business, and I didn't thank them for the crappy photo.

Too many people are focused on earning the public's money instead of offering quality.

"Update: I've been here many times since my original review below and have always had amazing meals here!  During the COVID-19 restrictions, they are doing carryout and have made this super-easy.  Call anytime after 1PM, place your order and pay over the phone.   Schedule a pick up time and when you arrive they bring the food out to you.   I had an order of buffalo cauliflower which I swear will win over even committed cauliflower haters.  The blue cheese mousse accompanying it is amazing!   The shrimp and grits was excellent; fresh, flavorful shrimp and delicious cheese grits all covered with a ham and mushroom sauce.   I also ordered the mixer for the Hound Dog cocktail; the order makes 4 cocktails.  You add your own bourbon at home although they note they can sell it separately if needed.   Since it's just me eating here during COVID-19 that means I have 3 more nights of cocktails ahead of me!   It is an activity too because they have instructions on how to finish the cocktails; you put the mixer, bourbon and mint leaves in a shaker with ice, shake and serve.  Yes, I know I'm stretching the definition of activity, but these are the times we're living in right now.   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for high quality take-out!   



Original Review: How have I driven by this place on College so many times and never eaten here before now?  I guess based on the name and appearance from the outside, I had the impression it was a supper-club type place with meat, foil wrapped potatoes and the vegetable of the day....boy was I wrong!  

I truly enjoyed my dinner here last night!  I started with a pearsecco cocktail which was excellent!  Nice pear flavor and not too sweet.   I had a wedge of cornbread which was excellent; crisp crust and tender, moist interior.  The maple butter was delicious!   I tried some of my friend's spicy green beans too which were excellent.  

They just changed the menu this week, and so there are a lot of tempting fall choices.  I had the pork cassoulet which was amazing!  Three kinds of pork over wonderfully seasoned white beans.   The pork belly was cooked perfectly; crispy with enough fat rendered out to balance the fat and lean, but still moist and tender.   The generous serving of slow cooked pork was fork tender and the sausages were seasoned nicely!  This is a hearty entree and would be perfect for a chilly day.  

I was too full for dessert, but want to try the bread pudding at my next visit.  It looked amazing!  

Service was great!  Our server knew the new menu well, was friendly and kept our water glasses full.  Courses were paced nicely.

I'll definitely be back!  Excellent food that rivals pricier options around town!   I still can't believe I never stopped here before now....",5.0,2,2

"McConnell's is apparently a Santa Barbara institution, and I can understand why.  The flavors here are pretty solid.  I've only been here a few days and I've already had their very tasty mint chip, and some of the best simple strawberry that I can remember.  I haven't had one of their waffle bowls or cones yet, but they look amazing.  Toppings, if desired, are heaped on.

It is a little pricey (a theme in Santa Barbara), and the shop itself can be annoyingly small when people are packed in, or they are mopping the floors which accounted for 2 of my 2 experiences there so far, but the end result of delicious ice cream is worth it.",4.0,2,2

"Umm, not so much anymore. Have gone here regularly for years, but I am left with the uneasy feeling this place is on the decline. First issue iis the shrinking menu. My three favorite menu items (sardine sandwich, black bean burger and brat burger) have all disappeared. Website says open until midnight on weekends. Got there tonight at 9:15 and was told to order at the bar and food would be brought to the table. Placed our order and then made trips carrying drinks and water to the table. Food was delivered to the table. One of the items was a salad with no discernible dressing. Do I go back to the bar and ask for dressing? While eating made a second trip to the bar for another round of drinks. Water glass now empty. Do I go back to the bar and ask for a refill. Throughout this process there was plenty of wait staff on the floor. With 18 tables some were receiving wait service others were not. Hard to figure out. Seemed like some variant of an Escape Room. Time to pay up. Made another trip to the bar You stand in line and wait every trip. How much to tip? I've essentially waited on myself. Have worked on efforts for restaurant staff to be paid $15 an hour. Tonight I have essentially provided wait service for my table for 90 minutes. Will I get $22.50 off the bill?

"This is hands down one of my absolutely favorite places to get breakfast in New Orleans. 

Service is consistently great and so are the food and drinks, this trip was no exception. 

We started with Bacon Bloody Mary's which were served with two giant strips of extra crispy bacon, spicy picked green beans, olives and lemon and lime slices.  The drinks were perfectly seasoned. 

I had the eggs cochon - 2 delightfully fluffy biscuits topped with perfectly seasoned pork debris with 2 perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise.  My favorite dish. Perfect as always. 

He had the Gulf Fish St. Peter.  This dish is VERY filling.  The cheesy grit cakes were perfectly seasoned and perfectly cheesy.  The fish was very fresh, light and flakey and the shrimp were cooked just right. The combination of flavors with the tomatoes, spinach and creole mustard hollandaise was well balanced.

"One of the people working was incredibly helpful, and the other one was seeming to have the worst day of her life. she proceeded to tell me I didn't order something I did, and the salads I were both drenched in dressing. The Caprese salad, which normally has basil, was served over a bed of iceberg lettuce, and the tomatoes on both that and the house salad were definitely too old to serve. My slice of pizza wasn't warmed in an oven, but a microwave. 

That said, the gelato looked great and the espresso was very flavorful, but I can't really get over the lady who told me I was wrong. She was also calling ""NEXT"" to each new customer like a high school lunch lady. 

Go for the gelato! Don't get the salads.",2.0,0,2
"GOOD FOOD TAKES TIME. My boyfriend and I love the Noble Pie in Midtown. When the South Reno location opened we were excited to visit because it's closer to our house. 

Noble pie has the best wings I have ever had. These wings will take you straight to Flavortown. I often find myself daydreaming about the wings at Noble Pie once a week at least. 

The  appearance of the restaurant is IMMACULATE. The decor is on point, very clean and awesome music. Great place to hang out. 

Noble Pie only serves the freshest ingredients possible and prepares everything by scratch and the pay off of their hard prep as soon as you take a bite. That being said-sometimes your order will take a little bit longer. 

While you wait for your food they have a wide selection of local brews and wines.

"Service was 2 stars, food was 3. 

As other yelpers noted, bring earplugs. The interior looks cozy and quaint, but with the jarring sound of a cafeteria. It's impossible to have a 1-on-1 conversation here. Great for groups especially after a few bottles of wine when the senses start to numb--all the more reason to shout across the table at the top of your lungs because you can't hear a single thing! 

We walked in on a Thursday night for a table for 2 with no wait. Although it didn't seem too busy, service was painfully slow. We were seated without menus and when we finally did get them, the waiter must have waited at least 15 minutes to come back to check on us. We ordered the rustico (their ""charcuterie"" platter), mushroom pappardelle, and the wild boar raga pappardelle. The rustico platter was a little underwhelming. It looked impressive at first glance, but the roasted vegetables were pretty boring and nothing was particularly memorable. It was all kind of standard fare, nothing terribly wrong, but nothing that would have me coming back for more. The highlight of the meal was the freshly made pappardelle pasta.  Don't underestimate the size of this entree. It looks tiny, but it's actually really dense and filling. I was pretty satisfied after all was said and done. Food is decent, but service needs some serious work. Oh, and be prepared to feel like you just left a rock concert when you walk out.",3.0,1,1

"Not very happy with the fence that was installed.
It's bad when after only 6 months my fence started to lean along with just about every post being loose including the ones near the gates that were supposed to be concreted down and weren't. my gates were uneven as well as the fence itself it doesnt seem your quality of workmanship is what you state in your adds and on your website. and all i was told its in the warrenty time period so we will fix it. well that's all great if it was done right in the first place but it never was I didn't have the pros you say you have and I expected more than what I was given which was nothing a big 0 for my trouble not even a small gesture to say you are sorry for the inconvenience of me having to take time off a second time because the fence wasn't done right the first time. I feel in return they should of offered me something possibly back of my cost of the fence. I asked that the owner please contact me but nothing no call. Feel like I was taken advantage of.
And since the second time they came to fix what was wrong they created a new problem where my gate that didn't seem to have a problem now does it leans with the wind and leaves a space between the two doors so my dogs can get out because the latch holder in the ground was left not buried properly.",2.0,0,0
"I stopped in to the Radisson Hotel for a lunch, I was quite impressed to see three choices of places to eat. Three is an English style Pub called the Lion's Head, as well as two spot to eat in the open atrium courtyard area. One is a full buffet with hot and cold items - the salad bar was quite nice. Then there is also a sit down style cafe. 

Besides the restaurant, there is a plethora of high tech meeting facilities, banquet rooms and even an eight hundred person ballroom! I was able to tour them all, and it is these brand new areas that get the Radisson to a 4 star in my books. They have a fitness facility complete with track, swimming pool and squash courts. And in the lobby I was really impressed to learn that they are the first hotel in Canada to have that high tech Hello Hotel system which allows people to text or tweet out to one another within the hotel. 

If you are looking to hold a meeting, conference or special event I highly recommend checking out the Radisson. They truly have the means ability and capacity to be able to turn anything that you need into a successful event.",4.0,2,2

The spring rolls were super fresh and the sauce that it came with complemented them really well. The pho here was definitely better than other Vietnamese places, the broth was so flavorful! I got the Bun Nuong with pork and my mom the bun Tom nuong. Both were delllicious! The pork was grilled just perfect with a subtle smoky flavor. 

The star of the meal was the iced Vietnamese coffee- easily the best in the city (pricey at $5 compared to other places but totally worth it). The service was very quick and efficient and our waiter was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu to help us out.

I just went there to get an ice latte and the person preparing it gave it to me in a 12 oz cup and said they were out of cold espresso so she made it fresh and filled the cup with ice, so I ended up with basically a 5 ounce drink that was warm for ~ $4 with less than one shot when I asked for 2.

We got the blackened fish du jour, it was redfish last night, and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I've eaten a lot of redfish in this city and I can confidently say this was my favorite so far.  It came with asparagus and the most delicious creamy sauce.  Even their starter garlic bread was decadent and just crunchy enough.

Our servers were an absolute joy!! Angelique was a sweetheart and checked on us constantly, She was very attentive!   Kevin, who I believe was our main server, was an absolute joy!!

Wonderful, pleasant, and attentive staff complimented a very neat and clean establishment where I sat and enjoyed a great meal value.  I've had the sandwiches to-go and also dined in with my wife...WE WILL BE BACK and will share the great news about Jersey Mikes.  Please keep it up with the delicious, fresh, aromatic, and beautiful looking products and excellent services...this style really works well for me and is THE BEST SUB EXPERIENCE I have had in Tucson in 15 years (sorry Jimmy Johns, Subway, and Firehouse).

"I can't get enough of Euphoria! Since they have opened up in Manayunk, I have gone back for manis, pedis, eyebrows, etc. The staff there is always welcoming and nice to talk to. They care about quality of their work, not how many people they can fit in to an hour.

More importantly, going to Euphoria feels like spa treatment without the spa prices. I have lived in Manayunk for two years, tried all the salons on main street, and this one takes #1. They are a welcome addition!",5.0,2,2
"My family stayed here for the past week. Child was one year old, so none of the kids activities applied to our child (only for kids above 5yrs). We had a good time hear, mind you we spent most of it off the resort. Here are my pros and cons for the resort. 

Pros;
Pool has a waterfall, cool for even adults. 
Kiddie pool was great. 
Pool has an attached bar. 
Cleaning staff was super accommodating. 
Great to have free shuttle to sand key beach (county beach). Hendra our driver was great. And they have beach stuff you can borrow for the day. Also, they will give you towels I take to the beach. 
Jetski rental available on site, but a private company so you cannot charge to the room. 
On site spa, my wife loved it. 

Cons;
Creepy bird in lobby, I like birds but feel bad for clipped and confines endangered species. 
Public access to the pool, so chairs fill quick. 
Pool bar is super expensive with beer in cans. 
Couldn't shut the doors between room sections if air conditioning is on because of air flow. 
Did not get the king bed we asked for, but made it work with queens. 
No racks to hangs anything in the rooms. 
No cribs, just pack-n-play. 
This resort does not recycle anything. Major turn off for me. ( the county beach does)
Bellmen seemed pushy when loading bags, just smashing things in my trunk. 
Restaurant food overpriced for the quality, not the same level as other Marriots we have stayed at before. Ate off site with better food at lower prices. (Check out Stephano's and guppy's seemed overrated)

Overall we might stay again, but due to the cost we would probably find someplace else to stay. For a weekend it might be worth it, but not a week. Can't say we had a bad experience overall, just less than expected I guess.",3.0,1,2
"What I cant believe is that this place has so many positive reviews?!?  I ordered lomi lomi, empress lo mein, shrimp toast and sweet and sour shrimp. They all had one thing in common- grease.

"I've had my fair share of ippudos and tottos in nyc and nom nom comparatively seemed like a low-key ramen shop down the street I always passed by. But I was craving something ""soupy"" since it's been raining all week and decided to stop by. Yelpers beware: I'm serious about my hot sauce game and my standard for spiciness surpasses reason (and the effectiveness of pepto). So without hesitation, I ordered the vegetarian karai ramen (spicy miso), not forgetting to ask to make it extra spicy. Good portion- I got the regular instead of a large and left beyond full- good condiment choices, reasonable price ($10 for reg), quick service, clean, and very friendly staff.

"Visually it's a beautiful venue to host an event. Despite the restaurant/venue being new the staff are quite new as well and have not been trained proper serving etiquettes. For this place to be named a premiere venue for events the owner and management are not accommodating at all. Employees were not aware of the schedule and had to wait for the owner/management. The owner prefers Wedding parties and considers it their primary source of event and will only offer Fridays or Sundays for non wedding events. To market that they can accommodate all types of events is a bit misleading and false advertising. They definitely started off on the wrong foot by declining non wedding events on Saturdays, not a way to start a business, you would assume corporate events and birthdays are just as special when trying to give your business exposure. Will definitely not recommend to family, friends or co-workers for this reason.",1.0,0,0

We don't shop at Belk but I needed to exchange some Ralph Lauren clothes for my toddler that were a gift. They didn't have many brands for his age group so it was hard to really find anything we liked.

She was older with blonde hair and glasses. She told me they were going to expand the children's side which will be great for us to come check out in the future. Even though they didn't have much to choose from she put the rest of the refund on a gift card and I'll just shop online. This was a great shopping experience tonight.,5.0,2,2

"The Dubliner is the Irish Pub we always end up at anytime we are out late on Wash Ave.  The bands that they have are usually pretty good. They have a great selection of beers including the local microbrews and your typical Irish Pub beer. 

I've came here twice for dinner. Both times I had the Bangers and Mash. I'm completely drawn to the horseradish sauce in it. My friend had the peppercorn burger  and added fried egg and smoked gouda. I have to admit it was pretty tasty even though I thought it was a little dry. 

The booths they have here are tall. They make me feel like a 6 year old. I wish they weren't that big, but maybe I just need to eat my Wheaties. They do have some private booths that are nice for a date night. It's just not what I think about when I'm thinking date night. For me, I'm a beer drinker so depending on what date we are on I might think it's ok to come here. First date? Not cool at all.

"I am so thankful for emergency vet care. I give 4 stars because Of my experience yesterday (1/8/17) the worst day ever. My little guy (10.5 years old) collapsed on me and I absolutely could not get help from Anyone closer to me. There is no doubt in my mind if I could have gotten him to help sooner he would have lived. I spend 40 minutes giving him CPR and lost him anyway. I am not naive. I knew it was a long shot. I do not blame this clinic for the loss. It was not their fault. The reason for my 4 stars is I could not get anyone to give me a straight answer on if they had gotten his heart to beat again. Everyone wanted to him-haul around and talk me into paying upfront $750 to even try and stabilize him but no one wanted to tell me if his heart was even beating. (I knew in my own heart it wasn't) when I finally got them to give me a half way answer we made the decision to stop CPR. not because of the price (which was incredibly steep) but because I knew he wasn't coming back. 
Thank you for trying. But in the future please just be honest when asked a direct question. I worked 5 years in animal Control, my husband is a public servant, we know CPR, we know death. Treat people like they mean something, rather than that their money is more important.",4.0,2,1

My mom came to visit me for a week and had some down time while I was tied up with some other things.

"The Shake Shack burgers stand out in a pretty good burger market. What keeps me from going here vs Bobby's and/or Five Guys are the fries.

The burger itself is flavorful, juicy/fatty and quite honestly delicious. You know how good it is cause you can just taste how bad it is for you. This holds true if you order a single, a double for the ""shack stack""

If I am going to saturate my body with something that bad, I might as well go all in and eat fries, drenched in delicious melted cheese.

The shake shack used to have crinkle cut fries. I believe in an effort to align themselves with their competitors, they switched to fresh cut fries.  Unlike Bobby's and Five guys, these fries are usually pretty greasy and aren't all that tasty. Adding cheese to them doesn't enhance the appeal, it actually made it worse (for me). I am not sure if this is all locations or just this particular one.

Go back to the original fries you had, with cheese, they were awesome!",3.0,1,2

"Came here on a Sunday night for their AYCE eat wings for 10 bucks (with endless fries). The quality is what you would expect from a deal like this - thawed fries and ok wings. Four flavors - Thai chili, honey sriracha, BBQ, and buffalo - served from buffet style warmers. Inconsistently warm as well as inconsistently sauced, which didn't endear it to me. But it's a great value deal, which is normally my most important parameter in food; I'm just not crazy about wings in general, hence the three stars. Other things: standard-y sports bar, with lots of TVs and such. They have a cool outdoor patio/pool setup, which I've seen hopping during warmer months.

"Honey's is a short 5-blocks from my house, a pretty nice walk on a nice sunny day. The food is Jewish/Southern. An interesting combination, but everything is super tasty. The wait staff is very kind and helpful. 

Food: 

-Breakfast: For those breakfast lovers out there, there are a lot of great breakfast options available and is served all day!

-What I get: I usually go for dinner. I'm a sucker for brisket and usually get Bubby's brisket sandwich, it is slow cooked brisket, served on a brioche bun with really good horsey mayo, swiss, and spinach. It also comes with pickled cabbage, and green tomato. The fries are handcut and very good (does not come with sandwich). Everything else I've ever ordered here has been fantastic, everything is cooked well, and has really good flavor. 

Their fresh limeade is awesome! I Highly recommend it.

The only downside is the menu is enormous and is sometimes overwhelming if you don't know what you're in the mood for. Also, they are VERY busy during breakfast and brunch times. I often walk/drive by and there is a line out the door waiting to be seated. It's usually pretty safe to go for dinner on a week night though.

"My boyfriend and I just purchased platinum annual passes a few days ago and have gone twice now. We appreciate the free preferred parking that comes with our platinum passes. We are from Georgia and have season passes to Six Flags which we've been going to all summer... and let me just say, Busch Gardens blows Six Flags out of the water. Busch Gardens is SO clean, the staff has been nothing but immensely friendly, the rides have LOTS of variety, the wait times aren't too terrible, all prices are reasonable, and there are plenty signs and maps located throughout the park to help us figure out where we are.

The ONLY warning I give to you inquisitive potential park-goers is this:

There are lots of wasps (mainly in the summer) and you very well may get stung by one. I got stung by one DURING the Cheetah Hunt ride on my back. I am pretty sure that the wasp somehow got behind my back right before the coaster took off, and then when the ride took off, I leaned back and got stung. I thought that the ride had somehow electrocuted me at first because it hurt so badly. Then I quickly remembered seeing the wasps all over the park and realized I had been stung. The first aid employee was able to give me Benadryl and some sting cream that helped. Another park employee told me that Busch Gardens sometimes closes the park just to spray for wasps so I know they are at least trying to get it under control. (So I'm not mad!!!) I still plan on going and can't wait to ride Cheetah Hunt again! Haha.",5.0,2,2

"After moving to town my boyfriend and I kept passing the Bar sign and keeping it in the back of our heads, gotta check it out! 

We came here a few weeks ago on a super packed locals night and though we waited a while for our food, we really loved our dishes. Service was slow but the kitchen really picked up the slack.

I know they have some fresh home made pasta and it's something I never ever crave so when this craving hit, I knew where to go! I made some reservations, just in case, which was not needed. We waited for them to set us up even though I had a feeling we'd have a better experience at the bar, which was okay. After 10 minutes of being told ""we'll be right with you"" and newer customers being served first, we headed to the bar instead.

Took a little while to find something we liked but I ordered their Arabiata and he ordered their Rib Eye, with a little love, I mean bread. 

The kitchen was a little slow for being a more quiet night, but I can't complain... the flavors were all there! 

Sadly, my boyfriend discovered his medium rare steak was in fact very raw, and while waiting about 8 minutes to ask the bartender to just heat it up for a quick minute he kinda got turned off so he sent it back, bummer. It looked so good.

So for me, I really really love the food, I think the chef is kick ass and knows their flavor. I acknowledge the kitchen is quite slow, and because of that it backs up the front of the house, pretty good if you ask me. Both times we had not so great service, but hey! It happens.

"Excited about eating at this restaurant since we had read it was open, Covid slowed us now, and finally an opportunity to visit, including a birthday celebration for a friend.

Ordered the Eggplant Parmesan appetizer to split between the four of us, was tasty, sauce was good, and while I prefer eggplant crispy, others were fine. Just a preference. 

A bottle of Sauvignon Blanc ordered up, oil on the table for bread, and eventually received salads, all ordered the Caesar, 3 with basalmic dressing, one with regular Caesar, all were pretty good. 

Bread was brought by, a conventional small Italian loaf. Entrees ordered, a second bottle of wine, and we got our food. The dishes we ordered ranged from ravioli (pretty good), a RAVIOLI POMODORO & STRACCIATELLA, LINGUINE FRUTTI DI MARE, FETTUCINE AL FILETTO, and LASAGNA BOLOGNESE. Prices were mid range...all the dishes were decent and a little different than other places.

Deserts of gelatos...good stuff, especially the passion fruit.

The only letdown was service, while our server was friendly and good, the support was lacking with bread delivered, no plates to use as we had used our plates for the appetizers, no silverware if you happened to have not kept your fork from your salad or appetizer. Seems a lapse there, slightly detracting from the overall experience.

A basic black tank top here cost 200 dollars! That is literally insane. Second of all, they promote selling real fur, a barbaric trade that almost all high end stores have gotten rid of. I was looking at a pair of slippers and they had real rabbit fur on them. I was so beyond disgusted. But I still went to look at what supposedly is an amazing sale. Most of the items were not on the 25-50 dollar rack, but rather half off the original price of 4-500 dollars. The items on the 25 and dollar rack were plain t shirts and some hideous dresses. Waste of my time. I've been in 3 times now and every time I go in there I'm more and more disappointed. Go to Knit Wit up the street instead (if you're in Bryn Mawr). Better selection for people that don't want to look like they are attempting last years fashion runway look, and... better prices!",1.0,0,0

Don't worry if you are standing to close to the other elevators a healthy security guard with a badge will appear from nowhere and ask you to stand on the side you belong on.  Once your ears have popped you will be on the 20th floor.  You will see about 4 armed guards 2 that will ask you to enter the waiting/processing room individually.  These are serious men but occasionally you will see their coolness ooze out from being allowed to carry guns.

This dish explodes with modern flavors that are spectacular in savory, sweet, and healthy!  We loved it!  A minor suggestion - maybe serve w/ fresh local fruit instead of salad in summer.

"So, my boyfriend (yelpie Paul R.) tells me that he made a promise to himself that he'd show me the best of NOLA.

Bayona claims: Our Restaurant Gives You New Orleans. Our Menu Gives You The World.

I am not at all surprised when he took me to Bayona. To those who have not ever been here and are contemplating on coming here...this place is quaint and located in a pretty hidden spot. There's a delicate and tasteful sign out front but unless you're looking for it, chances are you will probably miss it. Similar to Katrina R.'s experience, it was dark with a slight drizzle the night we went, which contributed to the difficulty to locate the venue. 

We were running a little late but the staff was was really attentive and welcoming. We were seated by a window/door in the dining area. As I have mentioned, Bayona is quaint and the setting is pretty intimate.

Prior to our visit, I did some research on Yelp and UrbanSpoon etc and the Veal Sweetbreads with Sherry Mustard Butter came highly recommended. And nope, the tangy, perfectly cooked sweetbreads bursts with flavor and was just as magical as everyone made it sound. It was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it too.

I was deciding between the Grilled Duck Breast (with Pepper Jelly Sauce and Wild Rice) and the Peppered Lamb Loin (with Goat Cheese and Zinfandel Sauce). Our server recommended the lamb and wow, I have never had such wonderfully prepared meat of any kind. Seriously.

I had my lamb prepared as medium rare and medium rare it was. The center was a deep shade of pink without blood seeping out and the outer edges weren't charred but cooked to what I would say perfection. The seasoning was amazing and the goat cheese really brought out the flavor. It didn't overpower the subtle Zinfandel sauce like I thought it might.

Paul really pampered me with the Bayona dining experience and set the bar high for restaurants in NOLA. My experience dining there is simply outstanding. I could not have asked for a better meal or a better evening.",5.0,2,2

"Wow...what a disappointing surprise.  I am a local and try to make it to Keegan's multiple times a year.  So today I took someone new to try Keegan's for dinner.  There was 4 in our party.  We ordered 3 appetizers which were good.  The Smoked Fish spread and Hot Crab and Artichoke Spread were exceptional. However, dinner for myself and 2 of my guests was a true let down.  Two of my guest had the fried oysters at my recommendation.  In the past they have been lightly breaded and delicious.  NOT TONIGHT!  2 orders of fried oysters came out exactly the same way, HIGHLY BREADED (almost doughy) and not good. The ""homemade"" cole slaw was tasteless.  My fish (the Southwest Cobia) was over cooked and the Spanish rice and beans were mushy.  

Now I need you to know that I take Yelp seriously and I am embarrassed that I suggested this restaurant (raving about my past dishes) and only the appetizers and 1 entree was worth eating.  However, I want to believe that since it is Labor Day, the owner was off and someone else (obviously a lesser chef) was cooking tonight.  Keegan's has earned a great reputation and I want to know that everytime I go I am going to have a great meal.  Hopefully, the owner can handle the cook who served substandard food in his restaurant.  He deserves to hold onto the reputation he built.  I will be back, but if the food is of the same substandard quality quality will end.  I hope this Yelp gives the owner a chance to correctly what is going on... In the past his food was AWESOME.",2.0,0,1

"It was so hot in one of the rooms that even the adults, who where just standing around, were sweating! When asked if the air could be turned down, the front door staff member informed me that the air unit had been broken for awhile now and they were having trouble getting someone in to fix it.
Also, we added the bubbles to our package well in advance prior to the party and when we arrived, we were told they couldn't do the bubbles because they were out of bubble solution. The birthday girl was super upset by this since she loves bubbles and was really looking forward to playing in them with her friends. I tried to make it fun for her still and do the balooon drop instead. The staff told us that the balloons were only about half full, but that they could still do it. We were then charged for $30 when we had to compromise and not even get the full experience. 
Staff who were playing with the kids were good. I did like the fact that they set everything up for you, however, it's a very pricey party for what you get! About $400 for 10 kids!

"Wow, I'm so glad they finally opened in Nashville! 
We used to have Bombasha, Brazilian steakhouse, and it closed. Then Rodizio opened and it sucks. 
Here their meat selection isn't small, meat quality is awesome, it's very tasty, not dry, doesn't taste cheap. 
I used to drive to Atlanta just to go to Fogo de chao. Now I don't have to anymore. They even have lamb chops, top quality! Now I have everything I love in Nashville. 
Wine is very good. Our server was able to get the best wine for our meal. Jakub, the server, is a very professional and courteous server. I'm very satisfied with him. 

Everything is great in this restaurant. Unlike Rodizio, even fried bananas and Brazilian cheese bread are authentic and delicious! I'd say it can compete with Fogo de Chao, for real. 

I've been to Texas de Brazil in Memphis and Niagara Falls and it wasn't good. Though, it's the same restaurant, but in Nashville, the quality of the meat is high.

"Actually a 3.5. This place is great if you want to eat something super filling and feel like a slug afterward. Regardless, the food is good for the money.

I was visiting my sister at UCSB over my winter break, and she insisted I try the California burrito (burrito with french fries in it instead of rice) because she was shocked that I had never heard of it before. The first time I heard about it I thought it sounded disgusting, but I warmed up to the idea and decided to try it.

Atmosphere: The place overall looks a bit sketch, but there are tables inside and outside.

Food: The California Burrito is pretty ginormous. I think the reason I'm docking points off is because of the french fries within the burrito. They didn't taste like they were cooked all the way - they were extremely pale and soggy. I think I would've enjoyed the burrito more had the fries been a little more cooked and crunchy. The burrito on its own was pretty good though - full of carne asada and other regular ingredients. It's just really heavy, so be prepared to feel that way an hour or two after you eat.

Service: Average and fast. Prices aren't too bad either.

Overall: Maybe I'll go again and try something new - my sister likes their breakfast and veggie burritos.",3.0,1,2

"Surprise highlight of the visit
We ate at the more touristy places (Mothers, etc.) but this was recommended. The prices were good so we decided to give it a try. I am very glad we did. Wife and daughter got the shrimp platter and the portions were HUGE. Son got Southern Fried Fish and again the portion was huge. I ordered a roast beef sandwich with gravy and while it was good I wish I had ordered something else. My bad, NOT the restaurant's fault. We had the combination appetizer with jambalaya, gumbo and red beans and rice and all 3 were delicious so I wish I had ordered a fully order of one of those. 

The real highlight was the dessert. We got the beignet fries. We went wild over them and had to have another order. They are really delicious and I know I will be craving them until I go back to NO.

"This is such a nice place to go for tacos with your friends and family! They have outdoor seating and regular seating. My friends and I wanted outdoor seating but they closed it off due to the impending rain so they seated us at the tables closest the the outside, which was basically open. We were disappointed about not getting the outdoor seating but were fine with the close to the outdoor seating too.. this made us feel like we were in a restaurant in Cali lol
The menu is simple with a good amount of different choices to choose from. Their tacos are per price ($2.50-3.50 each) which is not bad at all! You order by writing how many of each taco/dish you want on the paper they have at your table 
My friends and I shared the corn fritters (ball of fried corn + cheese), guac & salsa set (which was really good too - we loved the salsa verse and the Roja salsa), and the grilled corn (elote - so good!)
Then for the meal I got the Baja fish (super crispy on the outside yum!) & crispy rock shrimp which were really good! I would definitely recommend both.
My friends got the tuna tatako, pork belly, carne asada, cauliflower, and chicken chorizo tacos which they all loved. 
My one friend got a poor belly bowl which was okay.. they give you like 5 pieces of pork in the bowl which is okay.

"Summary - Try coming here in the day time to experience the cool bibliographic theme and avoid the night time douchey bartender.

Came here on a random Sunday night/Monday morning at 3am when other things were closing. I thought it was an interesting design and theme. The menu had little things like ""introduction, prologue, and epilogue"" as if the menu is to be read like a book. There were book quotes written on a board and some of the drinks were named after famous authors and novels so the theme was really interesting to me. The music was grungey nostalgic 90s alternative (incubus-style) so that was interesting. They had football on the screens. I didn't order any drinks, but we did order some food which the bartender didn't really seem to care what we wanted. I saw on yelp they had certain items and I asked the bartender if they had them and he looked at me like a dumbass for asking. Woops. Don't have to be a bitch about it. Chef Justin White contributed to the decision of going here due to the fact that he wanted a Cuban sandwich. He tried to order one, but the bartender apparently didn't understand and got him gumbo instead which is what my cousin got. I shared half a chicken caprese sandwich with my cousin. It was a high-quailty good sandwich. It came with chips that I didn't touch, but that's ok.

But this little café - surrounded, BTW, by like 6 Mexican restaurants within a stone's throw, offers up better Latin fare than many places north of Girard.  Prices are totally reasonable and the food is always super fresh and inventive while seeming comfortably familiar.  Love the tamales, breakfast burritos, veggie bowls, and fancy shmancy drinks like watermelon mint limonatta!",5.0,2,2

"I've decided to only give 3 stars for the fact that I have never eaten inside of this restaurant and have only gotten take out on several occasions. 
Take out has been decent overall! Meals include soup, crab rangoon OR egg roll, rice and your entree choice. I have to say that you do get a large amount for what you pay! Again my rating is low ONLY because I can't base it on customer service inside of the restaurant. I will say that the staff is always nice when I call to place my order and definitely nice when I arrive to pick up my order. 
Parking lot is always PACKED, even on weeknights. 
I've ordered the General Tso's chicken which is good! Not as spicy as I like, so I've started ordering ""extra spicy"" and they accommodate with no problems! Egg rolls are cabbage based and fried well. I will say that the rice is pretty good and not over salted like some places you'd compare.",3.0,1,1

The selection was very limited in the store but an associate was nice enough to add that they had a much larger selection on their website that they would ship to the store if we were interested. Honestly, if we wanted to order online we would likely order from someone with better prices because their selection seemed to cost about 15-20% more than other online retailers. We were willing to pay for being able to have it at the moment of purchase and being able to see it in person both of which lack online. I guess with the large amount of floor space a decent selection of desks would occupy, the bean counters decided it would be best used for other merchandise.",3.0,1,0

"Mio's is hands down the best place I've been to in St Pete for Mediterranean food. Before the pandemic, I would visit here (almost weekly) for their amazing lunch special chicken gyro. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and is cut smaller and it just makes the entire eating experience better. You aren't having to tear the chicken when you bite like most other places. Since COVID, they had to cut their lunch menu (I imagine to help maximize profits), but I still pop in from time to time for their chicken gyro dinner platter. Almost everything I loved from the lunch special, just in a different format. Despite it being on the higher end of what I typically spend on lunch, I just keep coming back for that chicken. I can't find that quality/taste/cut anywhere else. The staff is amazing, and you can tell the owner/chef really cares about his customers. I hope they're able to bring back the lunch specials one day, but until then I'll just have to try some of their other dishes... or let's be real, keep getting their dinner platter because that chicken is stupid good.",5.0,2,2

"Let's start by tempering the ""Best Mexican in NOLA"" thing with a little reality - A) There are actually at least 5 distinctly different cuisines that are all called ""Mexican"" in the US.  Mexicans would call them by their locale names, such as - Tejano (Tex-Mex).  El Gato Negro (EGN) is making what they'd call ""Suiza"" style food - distinctly high-end food served mostly in Mexico City.  B) New Orleans is just catching up to the Mexican food wave, so there's not a lot of competition.  

Now that we've dispensed with my academic exploration of the Gastronomy of Mexico... Let's have a DRINK!  EGN  has great margaritas.  Their house rita was delightlfuly fruity, with fresh orange, tangerine & lemon juices.  Their tradicional lime margarita was also excellent.  They have several other flavors but we were hooked on the house orangy one.  And they're a good size.  Down side... the ritas are pricey - $8.50 is the starting point.  Ouch.  

Chips & salsa were good.  We skipped apps and went straight for some big entrees.  The lady had the Red Snapper al Cancun - grilled with cream tequilla sauce & several jumbo shrimp.  The fish was very tasty and the shrimp were huge and tasty.  But the sauce was barely evident - just a small splash on the plate.  Weird because the sauce was tasty.  I had the ""Carne Asada al Macho"" (Great name for a steak - literal translation - The Manly Grilled Meat!)  Both plates $19 each. The steak was cooked perfectly to order, nicely dry rubbed and deeee-lish!  It came with choice of sauces and again I was surprised that the sauce was not finished over the steak.  Instead it was served on the side in a plastic ramakin.  Weird.  Both were served with rice and beans - which were very tasty. 

The service was efficient and nice, and though we did have to wait a bit (it's a small FQ location), they served us drinks outside while we were waiting.  

All in all, I'd go back.  But I hope their chef gets a little more ""saucy"".  And yes, it's the best Mexico City - style Mexican food in NOLA.  But Panchita's is the best Veracruzana style Mexican food in NOLA.  I like Panchita's better...",4.0,2,2

We ordered the Banana's Foster French Toast for the table, which was insane, and over the top. I couldn't have had it as a meal by itself but a few bites did the trick.  

All in all the Stanley did what was required which was to provide us with a substantial meal to assist in the recovery of our hangovers.   The staff was excellent as well; if you need a place to go and your right in the square, you really couldn't go wrong with the Stanley.",4.0,2,2

"This brewery is a solid average. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here; but chances are I'll continue to go back due to convenience. Nothing is necessarily bad, but I'm not especially impressed at the same time. Today I was drinking their blonde, my boyfriend their IPA and together we shared a pretzel. 

Pros:
-trivia every Tuesday!! Free to play!
-servers are knowledgeable and generous with samples to ensure you like your beer selection
-dogs are allowed outside when the patio is open (always a huge win to me!)
-board games available to play
-soft pretzel is amazing, comes with cheese and mustard, does not disappoint 

Cons:
-their beer is nothing special, good, but I am not blown away 
-ambiance isn't great, TV's tend to be loud and the few times I've been the audio speakers haven't been working creating a weird tv sound noise
-beer isn't brewed on sight, which isn't necessarily good or bad, I personally just appreciate it all on sight more",3.0,1,2
"I trekked out of the city to High Road Cycles and I'm happy to report it was more than worth the trip.  The shop is a total gem in the heart of downtown Wayne.  Most major cycling brands (think Trek, Specialized) were represented with a thoughtful selection in stock.  The mechanics and sales staff were friendly and knowledgeable, all clearly drawing on a wealth of experience from the road and the trails.  I was there for a fit on my cyclocross bike; while I was there, people rolled in and out with road, mountain, and time trial bikes.  Dan, who trained at Specialized, did my fit.  A great bike fit requires some hands-on assessment.  Dan was super professional and pleasant, making me really comfortable throughout the fitting process.  I appreciated that he worked with my bike to adjust the fit, making suggestions for new components where appropriate.  The bike feels awesome, the experience was awesome--I will definitely be back!",5.0,2,2
"We have always been eager to try Catahoula so when we spotted a Living Social deal, we snatched it up. We were thrilled to arrive on a Friday night and snag an outdoor table. Unfortunately for us, it was on a slant so it was a struggle to keep our water glasses from crashing to the floor. The service was good. We started with the fried pickles, which were good but not mind-blowing. I had the soft shell crab po boy and my fiance had the andouille sausage po boy. The sausage had excellent flavor, much more so than the soft shell crab. My po boy wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't great either. While we ate there were several kids running around between the tables - I love kids, but it wasn't the ideal dining experience in my opinion, but I guess that's what you get sitting outside on a Friday in a family-oriented neighborhood.

"A little taste of Cajun deliciousness. 

Ambiance: Located inside a hotel, this is a nice, modern space with contemporary tables, half booths and half free standing tables. The entrance is a small podium with a hostess and the hallway opens to the main dining area. It had just right enough space between tables to squeeze through, but not overly spacious. The light was dimmed with some beams directed straight at the tables. It was quiet except for the sounds of patrons. A very nice little modern space for a more-than-casual brunch or dinner. 

Food: We came during Happy Hour so we ordered a few appetizers (Crispy Boudin Balls, Popcorn Catfish, and Spicy Chicken Salad) and a dessert (Bread Pudding) since we knew we had to save our stomachs for another restaurants. The Crispy Boudin balls were indeed crispy on the outside and with a standard soft rice interior. It had an okay flavor but, if you're from the South, you might not be as satisfied. I tend to enjoy my boudin a little bit more seasoned. Popcorn Catfish was very good. The sauce on top was nice and basic to even out the heaviness of the catfish batter. The pieces were laid on top of a salad in a little plastic container. Presentation was nice but not practical. Pieces of catfish would fall down as I picked at the dish. Spicy Chicken Salad was amazing and definitely was the highlight of all the dishes. The chicken salad was not too spicy but definitely seasoned well and tasted fresh. It was served with cracklins which is a favorite among Southerners. The cracklins were plain and allowed the chicken salad taste to really come through. Finally, the Bread Pudding was good, not the best I ever had, but still delicious. It was not too sweet and had a nice standard bread pudding texture. It was served with vanilla ice cream, poached pears, whipped cream, and little cherries on top. I think the whipped cream and little cherries were overkill but that's my personal opinion. 

Service: The hostess greeted us upon entering and led us to our seats. The waiter was polite and served us timely and efficiently.

Final words: Overall, a very good spot to have a nice brunch or dinner that is more than just casual. It has good to delicious Cajun dishes and located conveniently in the Central Business District. I would recommend.",4.0,2,1

The warehouse-style building is trendy, open and relaxed - the first time I visited, I felt as though I was transported to Brooklyn or Chicago. Although it feels COOL to hang out here, it's not TOO cool - a welcoming and chill space to enjoy coffee, do some work, or meet friends.

Excellent options for coffee and food, including a spicy Chiltepin cold brew coffee, unlike anything I've ever tasted. Refreshing with a hint of spice at the end, and mixed with some cream, it even gives some chocolatey notes to the palate.

"I've been going to Benihana's for years.  Back in the day they were the only place I knew that did the Japanese Habashi thing.  I love watching the dicing knives and the juggling food.  It's a fun way to eat.

Unfortunately, Benihana has lost its edge.  There are so many better places to see and taste this type of food.  I always feel like I'm shuffled in and out without inexperienced chefs.  I recommend going to one of the many Mom and Pop places.",2.0,0,2

"We had the BEST meal here on a Saturday night. The service was excellent, from the person confirming our reservation on the phone to the host, server and sommelier. We had so many items on the menu and all were excellent and surprisingly larger portions than you would expect from a restaurant like this. A friend of ours was back at the hotel with her daughter so we asked our server Tony to recommend a good sandwich place nearby and without asking him to do so, he went out in the pouring rain to order a burger for her down the street and delivered it to us. He was amazing! I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.

I had the Wagyu Beef with truffled potato croquette and chanterelle mushrooms. I think I left a one inch piece of steak because I was so full. It was probably the best meal on the table. We also had the savory foie gras which was to die for, and many of the salads (chevre tarte, beet salad, etc) were really flavorful and amazing. The sommelier recommended a fantastic wine. Overall, an excellent experience there!",5.0,2,2
"Murf is AWESOME!!!!! I would recommend him over and over again. If I could give him a thousand stars I would! I got to my moms house for a visit from out of town and discovered that she hadn't been using her dishwasher for weeks because it was making funny sounds.  I am not from the area so didn't know who to call to get it fixed for her. I called many appliance repair places and MURF was the ONLY company to call me back immediately and fit me in to his schedule the very next day even though we live far out. 

He stayed in touch on the day of repair to let us know when he was coming! When he came to fix my mom's dishwasher, he diagnosed the problem, explained everything to us, fixed it and charged us not only an HONEST rate, but a VERY affordable rate. 

He also stayed a few extra minutes to talk to my sister who is getting ready to buy a house about what brand of appliances he would recommend...NOW THAT'S SERVICE! 

If you want a nice, honest, hard working and fair gentleman to come fix your appliances, CALL MURF!!! HE'S YOUR GUY!",5.0,2,2
"My experience with Society Hill so far has been above and beyond. My beloved cat recently had to have an operation to remove stones from his bladder, and from beginning to end, the entire experience has been great.

Cost: Others have mentioned that Society Hill is more expensive than other places. Maybe this is true for routine checkups, but for my experience that was not the case. VSEC and Penn both wanted to charge me $3-4000+ for the surgery. My normal vet is Companion Pet Hospital, but they had no availability in their schedule. I called around and Society Hill said it would be a maximum of $2600, assuming no complications. Since they were the cheapest (reputable) place I could find that was willing to operate on a Friday afternoon, I went with them. Skip ahead three days: my cat is being discharged to go home, and they give me the bill - it was only $1700! A full $900 less than what I was expecting, and only $200 more than the cheapest place I found (which didn't have the greatest reputation, and would not take him over the weekend, hence why I didn't take him to that place.) I had been so stressed, thinking I might have to take on a second job just to save my cat's life, so this was a very pleasant surprise. They were very understanding about the financial burden of such an expensive operation, and I did not find them to be pushy at all.

Transparency: Society Hill was very upfront about the costs and details of my cat's care, and I never felt like they were being secretive or hiding anything from me. They gave me a full itemized list of the potential costs involved with his surgery and aftercare upon my arrival. Some of the places I talked to refused to even give me a ballpark estimate over the phone. They also allowed me to stay with my cat up to the very last minute when they took him back for surgery, unlike VSEC or Penn, where they take your pet to the back room and you are generally not allowed to accompany them. One example: at Penn, they told me they did an ultrasound and saw stones in his bladder. I requested to see them for myself (not that I didn't trust them, but if they are recommending a several-thousand-dollar surgery, I would like to know for sure that it's necessary!) They told me that they couldn't let me watch them do an ultrasound, or even show pictures from the ultrasound. On the other hand, at Society Hill, they did a second ultrasound to check for the presence, location, and approximate size/number of stones before the surgery, and even though it was a tiny exam room, they were willing to accommodate me. The surgeon even explained what I was seeing while the other doctor did the scan. After the surgery, I was also allowed to visit my cat each day he was there.

Communication: The communication at Society Hill was top notch. I received 2-3 phone updates daily on my cat's condition. Everyone I talked to was incredibly friendly, down-to-earth, and caring. They took the time to explain things fully and were very comforting to me the day of the surgery when I was in tears (as opposed to the ""whelp, sucks to be you!"" attitude I have encountered elsewhere.) They never talked down to me or acted like I was stupid (which has occasionally happened to me at other places. Although I work in the healthcare field and am almost 30, I am often mistaken for a high school or college student and doctors assume I know nothing.) The front desk person, Ashley, actually researched prices for my cat's special food online to try to find us the best deal while we were getting take-home instructions from the discharge nurse. We were so impressed with the level of customer service.

Facilities: All the areas of the hospital that I saw looked clean and tidy. My cat spent the majority of his stay in a cage approximately 2.5 x 2.5 feet. It was basically only big enough for him, his litter box, and his food/water dishes, but that's ok - he just had surgery and needed to rest anyway. It seemed relatively comfortable. They put a towel over the opening to his cage so he could have his privacy and not get freaked out by all the people/animals going by, which I think he appreciated. I also liked that they have dedicated parking right next door - parking is difficult otherwise in that area.

Quality of care: I think the quality of care my cat received was excellent. They were very thorough, and my cat's incision looks like it's healing well. No redness or oozing, and the edges are holding together well.

Overall I am very pleased with my experience at Society Hill, and will recommend them to others.",5.0,2,0
"Terrible experience.

I went here with 2 friends the other night.  The food itself was not great.  I had a turkey burger which was very dense and heavy and felt like I was eating compacted turkey, with no other detectable flavors.  Still, not terrible, just not good.  The fries were soggy, but again not terrible and certainly not good.  The wine and beer selection on the menu was decent, but the beer my friend had ordered had already run out and was not available.  My friends' food was also ""not great, not bad"" (the scallop dayboat and the tuna sashimi).  Three stars for food. 

The servers meant well but were disorganized, inattentive, and clearly still getting their act together.  The hostess was fine, very polite.  However, the servers from the kitchen repeatedly brought food to the wrong table (they brought another partys' entrees to our table, and our entrees to another table - on two separate occasions!).  It took a long time to get our servers' attention to get the bill, and a long time for the bill to be brought once we requested it.  

The WORST experience was AFTER the meal!  I came home to find not one but TWO charges on my card - one for my dinner, and one for over $50 that I had not charged.  I called the next day, and was told someone would call me back.  No one called that day, but two days later someone called me and said that the $50 charge was a mistake on the part of the server, but since it was still ""pending"" that it would not make it to the final bill.  I checked the final bill, and the charge for my meal (significantly less than $50) was the one that was removed and the $50 charge had gone through!  I called back, and was told that the manager would call me by 5pm.  By 6pm when no one had called, I called again.  I spoke with the manager, and he said that this was ""strange"" as he knew the appropriate charge based on my bill, but never used the word ""sorry!""  He said that he would refund the appropriate amount.  I asked if it would be possible to remove the charge completely for my meal given the time and inconvenience this had cost me.  He said ""no"" and that the best he could do was refund the balance.  He also said that he would call the bank to fix the charge, and then call me ""right back.""  I'm still waiting...and my online account still has the wrong charge on it.

This is really a shame, since I love Audrey Claire and have never had such a problem there.  Twenty Manning Grill has potential but still has some major kinks that need to be worked out.  That would be fine, but the kink that CANNOT be worked out is inappropriately RUDE customer service and LACK OF RESPECT for my time as well as my money.   I will NOT be back.",1.0,0,0
"Came here for restaurant week and was very satisfied with this place. Waited only a few mins after our reservation to be seated inside which is very basic, table very close to each other but the food, service & byob will make up for it!! Appetizers we shared was Brussels sprouts, flatbread & arugula salad which was very tasty! Soup was basic. Nothing exciting. I had the chicken Milanese which was very moist inside, my friend had the other chicken dish which was just as tasty and moist!! My other friend had a pork chop which was huge! And tasty. She complained however how her asparagus tasted like gas (I assume wherever it was cooking on picked up the taste of the grill), my friend had the shrimp pasta which was soso to me. Shrimp very big and juicy but pasta fell short. For dessert we shared the chocolate cake which melts in your mouth delicious!! & the banana bread pudding was tasty but very filling. We were disappointed that they ran out of creme brûlée. All in all we were VERY satisfied with this tiny gem and I would love to come back.",4.0,2,2

"I have been coming to this place since it opened (and it was the Green Iguana) and its always been a good place to watch football. In my opinion, it is completely underrated in that aspect. Inside the restaurant is a huge TV projection and outside they have 4 TVs.... I also like that the sports crowd isn't obnoxious like I have experienced other places. The menu is a bit smaller than previously, but very delicious. They have great tacos and when they say something on their menu is spicy, they mean it.... That is very refreshing as many Florida ""spicy"" foods tend to be wimpy (lol, I spent a lot of time in the Southwest).... 

 Service is par, however I kind of wish the bartender had a little more training. I ordered a dirty martini and had to request an additional shot of olive juice as their was almost no ""dirty"" to the drink. He also declined making me a blended drink because he said we has terrible at it. As I commend his honesty, that is something that needs to be corrected. With that said, I have always had a great time here, the food is good, and the staff is attentive and courteous. A few amendments to this place will earn this place 5 stars :)...",3.0,1,2
"I'm a Connecticut Yankee through and through. I've never been to Louisiana. Thus, I don't pretend to know the first thing about authentic Cajun cuisine. However, I do know what I like and I like Cajun Kate's.

Actually, I love Cajun Kate's jambalaya. The friendly owner Don allows you to sample his offerings before placing your order. Once I tried the jambalaya, I knew that was what I must have. The very reasonably priced medium-sized portion was just right to fill me up for lunch. It was spicy, but not too spicy. My half-Cajun comrade assured me that this was the real deal, but that's not why I liked it. While I appreciate the authenticity, the most important thing is that it tasted darn good.

Who would have thought that the best Cajun food in the Philly area would be found in a largely Amish farmers market? I sure wouldn't have, but I'm glad I found this place. The only thing negative that I can say about Cajun Kate's is that it's only open on Friday and Saturday. Apparently Don is currently searching for a new location where he can operate more than two days per week. Wherever that location may be, I plan on swinging by for more jambalaya.",5.0,2,2

"Pretty dissapointed with U of Penn emergency care.  

Had an emergency with the pup and had to take her in here.  Maybe they thought I was being a pain in the butt because I'm a Vet Tech, though I made sure to apologize for my pet neurosis.  Honestly anyone working in the field should understand the torture of putting your own pet in someonelses care.

Front desk was pretty rude starting out with the girl telling me my personal vet hospital not being in their database.  She didn't really believe me about the address and that it was where I said it was (even though I told her I was certain about the address and worked there for 9 years).  The guy up front was friendly.

Told to call in the am for a plan of action and when I did I was told she was ready to be picked up.  After paying I found (had to ask for them) the bloods were never drawn again, so they did it right then (and were quick) but then come to find out she needed to be transported to stay on fluids.  I have no vet here and (the intern?) informed me I missed their reg. hospital pick up (never told when it was).  I had just finished my own shift overnight and was trying to piece it together and apologized for my tiredness she came back with a curt ""yeah, I'm ready to go home too""  

Whatev, maybe you need to rethink a line of work that is all about client communication even at 11 am after being up all night.

My friend got the donut sandwich with strawberry ice cream and fruity pebbles.  Mine was so good! Wasn't sure what to expect and thought maybe it would be too sweet, but nope!

On my visit there last night on a Saturday, there was one server for the entire restaurant. He was very apathetic and had a 'fuck off' attitude about him. He was blatantly rude to not only my table, but to every other table there. I had to ask for tahini sauce THREE times, and I finally ended up going to the kitchen to get it myself. No joke. Also, there was no music. It was completely silent with the exception of the waiter who was standing at one end of the restaurant and attempting to take orders from the table at the opposite end. When I asked him about the music (normally they have really cool Egyptian music playing), he said the guy whose ipod they normally use quit and therefore, they would not be having any music. Normally I'm the type to get a hookah and lounge for a couple of hours, but this time I got my check and ran for the door. With the horrible service and awkwardly quiet atmosphere, it was just unpleasant. So I meandered on down to the new hookah place in Broadripple: Lava.

"I had been going to Sparks nails for over a year, and was happy with the services. But all it takes is one horrifying experience to take my business elsewhere. 

Let me share my horrifying experience. I go in, and no the staff seemed to be bickering. I sat down with a nail tech that was new to me. As I needed my nails done that day,  had been happy with others there, didn't think it would be a problem. 

She asked me what nail shape I wanted, so I showed her a picture of my own nails that I had previously had done there.  She started doing my nails and literally asked me not to watch her do my nails. I was in the middle of the service, and so didn't say anything, as I really didn't want her to screw up my nails. 

When she was to the shaping part, she asked me how was the shape. I wanted oval, as the picture I had shown her clearly were. 

She showed me the first nail, and it was square. So I corrected and showed her the same picture once again. She then angrily cut the other nails to make it easier to shape into oval.  At this point she she bickering with the other staff. So I am just sitting there uncomfortable with significantly shorter nails. 

When she was done, she put the color on my nails. It wasn't like the nails that I had gotten done before at that salon!  So I hastily picked another color just to be done with it. She sloppily put on the color as I will show in the picture. 

In my over 20 years of getting my nails done professionally, and even after getting really terrible nail jobs, I have never had such an awful experience and service in that time. 

As I am terribly polite to a fault, I think some people mistake this for being meek. She attempted to overcharge me for having to reshape the nails. As I told her that I had showed her a picture of exactly what I wanted, and wasted my time,  that would be a no to the overcharge.  And showed her the picture again. 

I paid by card, as I usually leave a  generous cash tip. She then angrily asked me what I wanted to leave for tip. And for the first time in my life at that moment, decided not to leave a tip.  So told her there would be no tip.  So it was 35.00 for an acrylic fill-in with gel nail polish.",1.0,0,0

"This place is amazing. It is probably the best lunch I've ever had. The cocktail selection is great, they have delicious wines, and an excellent food selection. In the group I went with, we had a vegan and a gluten and dairy free person. We told our server this and he marked up two menus - one with all the vegan dishes (or ones that could be made vegan) and one with the gluten and dairy free dishes. It was so great - the server we had, Nick, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. He offered crudites to dip in the hummus for the GF person, which she was happy with. 

The curry fried cauliflower was so so delicious. Do not miss it! We ordered most things from the menu and loved everything.

"We usually love the gelato here and come quite often. Very fresh and unique flavors. But I have to say that the staff isn't trained well at all.

I get a small every time and some times my cup is filled and at times it isn't. That is unacceptable considering the prices are pretty steep. We were here tonight and a girl with a grey cap barely filled our cups. And we said something to her & she assured us that she gave us the correct size when I know for a fact she didn't. The cup wasn't filled and there were gaps in my cup that should have been filled with gelato. We had two girls take our order. The one girl filled the cup and the other one did not.

"I've been to this museum years before and loved it. However, I didn't last 15 minutes this time around. I was repeatedly harassed by a ""security guard"" or whatever position he holds, by the name of Jorge. I had a cloth mask on that slid below my nose. He approached me while I was in line to get on the elevator and asked me to pull it up, which I did. A few minutes later, when we were upstairs, I see he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. I had my face mask on and continued to mind my own business until he felt the need to approach me yet again and say he saw me pull my mask down when I turned the corner and if I can't conform to the rules, then I would be removed. This was not true, as my mask was up. My mother even proceeded to hand me a disposable mask to placate him further and he continued to reprimand me, threatening to kick me out. At that point, I told him to keep away from me. I let him know there was no way I was going to tolerate his constant surveillance since I was wearing my mask. When I voiced my concern to the other security staff, they dismissed me and told me it's his job to essentially stalk anyone he feels is not obeying the rules. The ironic part is that he was standing way too close to me and not adhering to the 6 feet distance rule himself. I will never return to this museum, as I paid quite a lot of money to be made to feel like I was a criminal. The only refuge I was able to find was at the cafe. What a strange and disappointing experience.",1.0,0,0
"I would really give this place 3 stars for the pizza but they earned an extra star for doing thin  crust.  The pizza crust was a nice attempt....really I mean it in a good way.  I haven't had decent pizza since moving out here from NJ and trust me on this one.  We ordered the Margarita because simple is best....in theory.  If the crust holds up, you don't need much to have a great pizza. Now the Margarita I had at this place passed the visual test, the crunchy crust, good proportion of marinara and mozorella and Basil. However, the pizza didn't ""hold up"" when you fold a slice in half... it drooped. I've seen it too often with the bread dough products in this part of this fine country.  They said NYC pizza is good because of the water, I'm starting to believe it. Pizzology, it's not your fault.",4.0,2,2
"Pizzeria Stella is a simple yet great Stephen Starr restaurant located in Headhouse Square. I love the pizzas here because they have an ultra-thin crust, so you aren't left feeling stuffed and bloated after eating a few slices. Stella offers a very cozy atmosphere inside with a brick oven and is a great place to go on a winter's night, or if the weather is nice you can sit outside along the sidewalk and people watch.

I have tried several of their pizzas, and my favorites are: the Pistachio, the Sausage, and the San Daniele. The Pistachio is definitely my number one. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I also highly recommend the Sheep's Milk Ricotta appetizer and the Arancini. Top it all off with a cold Peroni, and you're good to go!",4.0,2,2

"I realized once I picked up our to go order that I have been here once before. I remember enjoying it the first time dining in.

This time, we ordered pick up and it still tasted pretty good. The crab Rangoon is a must get. They fill those suckers versus most other places that only fill the inside a little and you have a lot of extra crust. I highly recommend the crab Rangoon.

I ordered mild chicken pad Thai. It was a huge portion and really good but it was very dry. It could have used a bit more sauce or something to make it go down easier.

My friend ordered the Thai basil chicken with veggies and that looked amazing...will have to try that sometime!

Overall though, really good Thai place and would eat there again.",4.0,2,2
"Worked late tonight, so got carryouts from Boogaloo. Three dinners:

Jerk chicken drizzled with key lime aoli, Cuban rice and honey-roasted plantains -- $13.95

Cajun rubbed beef tenderloin, With yucca mashed potatoes, homemade Worcestershire and spinach -- $20.95

Creole jambalaya: seasoned rice with smoked sausage, chicken and shrimp -- $14.95

Jerk chicken and creole jambalaya got a side of yucca mashed potatoes to share.

The SNAFU came in that we were ordering off a menu that described the jerk chicken as having steamed mussels, shrimp and market fish -- none of which was there. And actually, the menu wasn't clear whether those swimming elements were with the chicken or the Cuban rice.

But either way, they weren't there. I would have gotten something different if I'd known those elements weren't coming with the dish. The key lime aoli was there visibly, but not to the palette. The jerk wasn't that jerky.

The plantains were fabulous.

The Cuban rice was rather tasteless -- saffron-infused (per the description and the color of it, but couldn't taste it!) with black beans and peas. And two tiny bits of red bell pepper.

The beef tenderloin was cooked according to specs, and gobbled up.

The jambalaya was proclaimed great. Beef tenderloin was going to get the jambalaya, but refrained in case it was too spicy. But she tried it, and it fit her taste buds. But also fit the taste buds of he who ordered it -- who likes spicier food. So that was interesting!

The yucca mashed potatoes were tasty. Nonetheless, we all proclaimed, ""Where's the yucca??""

"Drive the extra 6 miles to west port!  Fuzzy's has great food and awesome drinks, but it's hard to appreciate that at the St. Charles location because of the three ring circus you have to get through before you get your food.  I've been there twice and both times I got half of what I ordered.  I had to go back up to the window to get the stuff that was supposed to be on my food both times.  The employees had major attitude and handed me cups of what I was supposed to get instead of just making my food the way it should have been made in the first place.  They also changed the contents of the beer-rita I get, but they didn't change the menu.  So instead of ordering a drink and getting it, I had stand with the bartender and decide what I wanted to substitute two of the ingredients for.  I worked in a restaurant for a long time, so I get it that things happen.  The attitude and snottiness from the employees was way too much.  I strongly suggest going to the west port location.

Between my last review and the last time I went (Aug. 2012)  The mini golf course went waay down hill - unless I was just here on an ""off day""

We couldn't play two of the holes because they were under some kind of construction and one other hole was flooded out.. it might have rained like two or 4 days prior.  HOWEVER the entire place smelled because they hadn't cleaned up the algae build up in the waterfalls in god knows how long.  It was disgusting.  We had to tell the workers about it so I hope they cleaned up and fixed up the course since.

When we first walked in it was very busy but the hostess made sure to keep updating us on when we were going to get a table so we weren't just awkwardly waiting. The place is divided into two main areas: the first area has a bar and a ton of tvs and is much smaller than the large open second area that also has a ton of tvs with sports playing on all the channels. We sat in the first section and ordered a Fire in the Hole (I think that's what it was called) pizza that had sweet and spicy sauce, meat, jalapeños and about five lbs of cheese! It was delicious! We also ordered side salads. All of the portions were very generous!! We only ate three slices of pizza combined and we were so full we could hardly get up and walk to our car.

"This review kills me, because I really do love Popeye's chicken, perhaps even better than KFC. I never had a problem coming here until now, my first visit in a long time. This review isn't about the food, because the food has remained consistently great each visit. The service and location on the other hand has gone down hill. My mom and I stopped in around 4PM, at this point there was no line. There were two spanish workers who talked really fast and who we couldn't understand at times, which made ordering tougher. The first thing that was strange was there was no chicken tenders at all, which made us alter two meals (my meal which changed to a chicken sandwich and we had to call the third member of our party who was not present to get a new meal the fish combo). After that, we ordered the fish combo that was a alternative that we saw on the website and then the two attendants were trying to tell us that they didn't offer that combo anymore and we had to order the rice separately for more money, despite being advertised on the website for this specific store as well as the menu behind them. At this point there was a line forming behind us, so we we're eager to get out of there...but not before checking our order and realizing the rice we paid extra for wasn't present and we had to go back in. 

All in all, I love Popeyes and I love the food (even if no chicken tenders was a bit bizarre) but this location isn't what it once was and I might think twice about coming back after today even though this is the only Popeye's around. Not to mention the small and cramped parking lot and drive thru are a pain and leaving on North Broad Street either way is always crowded and tough, things I didn't like even before this visit.

"Review:  Mr. Dale Yeager/Seraph Problem Solving

Service:  Private Investigation (Private Investigator
July 18, 2016 message : You hired a pro! )

Contracted: To deliver to us the name of the person or persons who privately falsely accused me/us of wrong doing which is a total fabrication.  This devious lie devastated our life plans, reputation and family relationships.  The only piece of information of any value to us, the only reason we hired Dale Yeager/Seraph was because he assured us that he & his ""operatives"" ""connections"" would deliver documentation of false accuser(s) identity.

Process: Private investigation:  Mr. Yeager insisted that we needed to pay for background checks as well which were of zero value to us in addition to paying for his time to obtain the above-mentioned documentation.

Through Thumbtack my husband and I contacted Dale Yeager of Seraph Problem Solving Company to obtain concrete evidence of the identity of the person(s) who made fraudulent accusations against me.  Through email on Thumbtack, In his initial contact Mr. Yeager stated that his agency consists of retired Federal Agents, Secret Service, FBI special agents, and US Military intelligence working in all 50 States, Canada and Internationally.  We sent an email explicitly explaining that we need the above mentioned evidence.  Mr. Yeager sent another email a few days later stating that he had experience with this type of case & requesting our phone number. 

Outcome:  We were owed the duty of care by Mr. Yeager through the special relationship contractually created to obtain information of a delicate nature which he assured us he would obtain but we received nothing but a background check that was of no value to us. It seems to be a way to pump up charges. 

Presenting himself as a professional and pointing us to his (Seraph) website which looks like an affiliated law firm (it's not), he misrepresented himself and promising to obtain proof of identity of false accuser, which is all that was of value to us without performing due diligence to be sure that he could obtain that information and subsequently providing us with nothing we requested and involving us in a sting operation that we are not qualified for and caused us great harm he directly caused extreme emotional injury that can never be repaired, damaging our relationships with family forever.  Deceiving us into believing he could obtain crucial information destroyed our chance to clear our name and to go ahead with our important plans. 

Mr. Yeager breached his duty, adding a new layer of damage that can not be repaired & our life plans are destroyed.  He didn't have the decency to return our funds when he realized he couldn't do the job because he didn't do his due diligence, nor did he have the contacts nor ""operatives"" he claimed could perform same, instead he became angry, involved us in a dangerous sting operation and refused to return our funds.

Had we known that we were dealing with a cell phone, post office box and Karate studio we certainly would not have wasted our time and money.   We have not located a PI license in his state much less to practice in our state.  His dereliction of duty caused us massive problems and heartache and we could have hired a properly licensed firm had we known the truth.  

The ONLY reason we hired Mr. Yeager was because he assured us he could obtain the identity of the false accuser(s) He didn't know he couldn't obtain the information he promised & took zero personal responsibility.  What we got for our $$ is never ending regret 
 
Mr. Yeager accepted our case without checking whether it was possible for him to legally obtain the requested records in our jurisdiction.  

I explained to Mr. Yeager that I'd been told that state and local government would not allow us to review the relevant records, nor anyone else without a court order and that the attorneys I contacted said the same, adding, that the few who would consider taking the case did so explaining that they could not guarantee that a court order could be obtained.   Mr. Yeager basically said that people in the county/local government don't know or have been misinformed and he could obtain copies of the records.

When I contacted Mr. Yeager he sent me the following link (http://www.seraph.net/services/legal-investigation-litigation-support-due-diligence/) and wrote ""we can help you, we have special capabilities""

He further sent :  ""The SERAPH Team consists of experienced retired Federal Secret Service FBI Special Agents and U.S. Military Intelligence officers.""  

""We work in the U.S. (ALL 50 states). Canada and Internationally.  But we need more information to give you an accurate fee.""

""Please contact me by email dale@seraph.net or on my direct line"" ""Thank you.  Dale Yeager. SERAPH"" ""

"I ordered this place for a take out night and the first order I made was for flan and empanadas columbiana. Let me tell you, they are really good! The empanada filling was tasty and the side dipping sauce was very light and spicy. A great addition!

I also ordered the carne mechada entree and the beef was dry and the flavor was decent but nothing that I would refer to as spectacular. Pretty much a regular spin on shredded beef. The plantains were firm, the black beans tasted like black beans should, nothing extra. The white rice was cooked well, not over cooked at all. 

The flan was amazing. Perfect. Light. Creamy. The way flan should be.

"Coming into this restaurant was a mistake. The service and the organization and management of this restaurant was terrible. 

We entered and were seated immediately. Our order was placed and then we waited.  We saw 4 other parties arrive, get seated and eventually get served.  We waited patiently as our order was sushi and it takes time to hand craft a good sushi roll. The other diners had ordered the teppanyaki grill option.  As we waited for our meal, we noticed that 5 tables around us had small mistakes in the delivery of their meals. Items not ordered or items ordered for other tables were delivered in error. After 50 minutes of waiting patiently, being assured by the waitstaff at the 30 minute mark, that the food was almost ready, I inquired about the delay. 

The manager said it was busy and they were filling take-out orders and that sushi takes time. No apology but a gruff excuses delivered to without making eye contact or even facing me.
As we had plans, I asked for the check to settle up for the single glass of iced tea. It took an additional 10 minutes to get a bill.  As we waited, we learned that part of our order was delivered to another table 30 minutes prior.  This implies the kitchen was not backed up but rather nobody knew what was going on. 

I strongly advise against patronizing this establishment if you plan on doing anything after dinner.  There is a good chance you won't get your order and certainly not correctly.",1.0,0,0

"This was my first year at Screamageddon. I went with a group of friends and we bought the VIP fast passes. They are worth the price because we didn't have to wait in the general admission line for each attraction. The actors in the haunted venues are top notch - they never break character and the props, makeup and scenes are all well done! I love that they have an assortment of ghouls interacting with the crowd in the midway area. The haunted walk in the woods is spine tingling. The 3D house was my favorite because it is so different than the other haunted attractions. I also loved that you have the choice of being touched or not - if you want to become part of the action, there are two interactive haunted attractions that offer glow necklaces. A few in our group wore the necklaces, and some were too scared to wear them. The staff members do a great job of explaining what will happen if you wear the necklaces - you'll be grabbed by a ghoul and separated from your group while going through the haunted attraction and you'll become the ""victim"" of an untimely ""demise"". No spoilers here, but each of us who wore the necklaces got to experience very different ""endings""! It was a lot of fun and we'll definitely return next year!",5.0,2,2

Not too loud, not too quiet, friendly bar staff, great bar snacks, and of course very very great drinks! 
My hubby opted for a coffee fusion beer ( pretty cool ) !

"Great coffeehouse and breakfast place! We had a gluten free breakfast sandwich and a poached eggs/homefries/pecan sausage dish. Cool place to go if you are gluten free, dairy free, or want some vegan options. We came back two mornings in a row. We didn't try the smoothies but say at the bar where they make them, and they look fabulous! Unique and fresh ingredients. The barista even gave us some good smoothie ideas to try at home!",5.0,2,2
"We went for a celebration dinner and were not disappointed.

I have certainly eaten my share of steaks and this bone-in Kansas City Strip was the best I have had. Flavorful, cooked perfectly and tender. 
Side dishes are family style and portions are large. All steaks come with a very, very large cooked, glazed carrot. The dessert was quite disappointing. The carrot cake was more like a spice cake - hardly any carrot flavor, no visible carrot shreds (surprising, since we knew they had large carrots!). The frosting was sticky and overly sweet. 

Service from the waitstaff was excellent. One honest mistake at the end of the night - busboy boxed up the wrong leftovers and threw away the ones we wanted to take home. Otherwise, everyone was highly attentive and helpful.",4.0,2,2
"The Library Restaurant is located in an old French style mansion, or more correctly the site of a former French restaurant that was built to look like an old mansion.
Not knowing where to head to for dinner, the hotel manager gave his recommendation and ever glowing review of the Library. He made it sound so good, we quickly called for reservations. Being a holiday....in Indianapolis race weekend is a holiday, we were worried about getting a reservation. No worries! They were happy to accommodate us. 
Upon arrival we found ourselves as their first reservation, and given the choice of the dining room or the bar. We chose the bar because local coverage of the race was on the local news and Amy/Michelle the bartender was friendly. 
We started the dinner with glasses of their house merlot and white zin, both were very good. Connie and I both ordered the baked French onion soup that was excellent! Connie ordered  the beef tenderloin salad that was slightly on the spicy side. Our server Ebony quickly noticed something wasn't right and had the chef make Connie a new salad without the seasoning. The second salad was perfect to Connie's liking. I ordered a prime rib end cut, that was pure perfection. It was served with garlic mashed potatoes, and green beans. Desert was an exceptional creme brûlée. 
For this part of the review, the names will be changed or not even mentioned to protect the innocent. We found ourselves seated next to patrons that were employees of several race teams. It was fun swapping stories about Indy and racing. Back in the day my dad used to race, and my godfather was an Indy crew chief. It's amazing how small of a world this is, as we all seemed to know the same people. 
The Library isn't just a place for great food, it's also the perfect place to commensurate before the 500.",5.0,2,2
"This was my last ""snack"" before heading back to Denver and it was filling, tasty and satisfying. We had the pork empanadas they had a slight kick and a nice mayo based dipping sauce.

"Bad experience from walking in the door. Several workers walked by the Host stand as I stood waiting. Never greeted. When someone finally did come up after I had watched her moving tables around, she immediately said, do you want to sit at the bar it's right around the corner.... Once I chose a seat at a bar table that wasn't cleaned off, I waited and waited. Finally the Bar server/Bartender came over grabbed stuff off the table but never said a word and never actually wiped off the table.
Needless to say I ordered food (because I had a free Birthday Burger reward)... sweet potato fries were burned yet cold... burger was dry and bland not delicious at all. I ask for regular fries instead, they also were not hot, had no seasoning and pretty gross. I WILL NOT EVER GO BACK",1.0,0,0
"I was in NOLA on business and my client recommend Rio Mar.  I am very glad he did.  I ate at the bar and the bartender (wish I could remember her name) was very friendly and helpful with the menu choices, she also made a great Caipirinha!  I had the ceviche mixto and the steamed mussels with Chorizo.  Both were amazing and they did not skimp on the Chorizo!  But I have to say the best part of the meal was the tres leches cake!

"We went there for our 14 month old sons first haircut. It was a wonderful experience. Our stylist was Laura, she was super sweet! I was worried of course how our son would react to getting his haircut. He did awesome! The kids chairs and Netflix shows are definitely a good distraction. Laura gave him a cute little Mohawk! It takes a special kind of stylist to be able to cut kids hair. They use clippers that don't make any noise. Our son left with a fresh cut, a photo, certificate, and a balloon! I definitely recommend this place for any parent! Will be returning when it's time for another cut!",5.0,2,2
"The food might be okay-good range, but it just isn't worth waiting for. Once we sat down we waited 30 min for acknowledgement from the waiter. Everything related to be service after that was just slothful. We almost never had full water glasses. If it wasn't for one little bus boy we wouldn't have had water until 30 min after the meal... 

The only reason they get 2 stars instead of one is that the peperdelle was above average (think 60th percentile), and one of the lobster / pasta dishes I tried to was actually pretty good as well. The rest of the food was run-of-the-mill, and really nothing special (or worth the $$$)",2.0,0,0

"I was excited to see Piquant opening another location. This small store is in West Tampa next to the library.  They kept they same fun and whimsical design and feel as the larger store.
We walked in and there are a couple of high tables and a very small case of treats.  I was really surprised to see no bread, which is why we came to this location. I was informed it would just take a few minutes to bake one. Fabulous. Here is the disappointing parts. There is no restroom.  The service is lackluster and uninterested.  A mistake was made on my order and the cashier blamed me. The bread was only ok.

This store is HUGE as far as yarn stores though (although I have never been to Webs in Massachusetts...). They have an awesome selection and the most Koigu KPPM I have ever seen before- they must have had every single colorway! They also carried the entire line of NORO as well as almost all the other brands they carried. The store has tables and comfy chairs scattered throughout making it feel very comfy and homey. The decor is very cute and modern and overall it is a well organized and pretty store. I could spend hours just rummaging through the amazingly vast amount of yarn they carry. I was warned that the service would not be very impressing but I found it to be very satisfactory. The employee came and asked if I needed help a few times to make sure I was doing okay. If you are ever in the area it is totally worth checking out!,5.0,2,2
"From first impression to last bite, this shop/restaurant was utterly charming and delightful. We stopped during a bike ride on the Monon, and we were sweaty and hot. We were greeted with delicious yellow watermelon (even though we hadn't even bought anything yet) and got help in ordering food. We got a pound of the barbecued pork, a side of cole slaw, and two lemon shake ups. Oh. My. God. Even though it was hot and sunny and we sat outside at the big tables, we were cooled by the lemon shake ups and DELIGHTED by the delicious pork. The cole slaw was the best I've ever had. It was almost a magical meal. Plus, amazing service. Kind, friendly, accommodating, and wonderful.",5.0,2,2

"From 2003 to 2005 I lived in Okinawa Japan.

Delicious and a perfect proportion, the restaurant is very clean and the service was perfect, I left today after eating there wanting to go back immediately.

"I am writing in regard to my experience as a post-operative patient of Dr. Anthony Michael Sciascia, II, MD (License No.:  16951), (Dr. Sciascia for future references), an Emergency Physician with Renown Health Systems.  The following link will take you the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners where you can enter his last name and review his previous medical background and training (https://nsbme.mylicense.com/verification/Search.aspx).  

Earlier this week, I had the misfortune of interacting with Dr. Sciascia in one of the Emergency Rooms (ER) associated with Renown Medical Center.  I have never come into contact with such a rude, condescending, and offensive health care provider.  I should note that I, too, am a doctor and Federal Law Enforcement Officer, so I deal with difficult personalities on a daily basis.  I would also like to note that I would never treat any of my patients, no matter who they are or what they've done, the way Dr. Sciascia treated me.  This is unacceptable, and I intend on bringing this to the attention of anyone who may come into contact with this physician, someone who should not be allowed to treat patients.

When I went to the ER, I was two days post-op, and in a considerable amount of pain.  As I previously mentioned, I was unlucky to have Dr. Sciascia pick up my case.  From the first moment I met him, there was something odd about his demeanor and he had the worst bedside demeanor I have ever witnessed.  My friend that accompanied me to the ER said the exact thing, and she actually picked up on this vibe before I did.  As an aside, all of the nurses were flabbergasted by my account of what occurred during my interactions with Dr. Sciascia.  

Long story short, Dr. Sciascia essentially accused me of drug-seeking, and told me that he didn't believe that I was actually experiencing pain, despite being 2 days postop.  Dr. Sciascia was literally trying to instigate an argument with me, which I refused to engage in.  He compared to me heroin addicts, which I am not, as well as misusing my pain medication, which I did not.  Dr. Sciascia then compared me to other patients he has seen with ""broken bones sticking"" sticking out of their skin and that they refused to take any medication at all.  First of all, I dislike being compared to other people, especially when their injuries are not even close to what my surgery or pain entailed.  As a man, Dr. Sciascia does not know how painful certain 'female conditions' can be, so it is extremely rude to dismiss as if it meant nothing.  Dr. Sciascia invalidated the pain I was experiencing, and I refuse to let anyone treat or speak to me in such a manner.  

Prior to being released from the ER, he informed me that I was going to be prescribed Gabapentin, a drug with which I am familiar.  Gabapentin, also known as Neurontin, is a medication used for neuropathic pain, not postoperative pain.  I asked Dr. Sciascia how that would be helpful in my situation, and he literally said, ""I don't know.""  My friend advocated for me by asking for something that actually helped me, and he switched it to a muscle relaxant, which I refuse to take.  I am unfamiliar with that medication, and I have lost trust in doctors in Renown's ER.  

More than one nurse I came into contact with during my several hour stint in the ER informed me that Dr. Sciascia ""has a really weird demeanor...[and] has no bedside manner.""  They said more, but I hope you get where I am coming from.  

I will be taking this to the medical board of NV, as well as any site on which a review can be posted.  Dr. Sciascia caused more harm than good, as I was extremely upset when leaving the ER, and I was still in pain.  Given that I have only had one experience with Dr. Sciascia, I cannot comment on his overall competence as an ER Physician, and it would be unethical of me to do so.  I can only speak to my personal experience with Dr. Sciascia, which was so horrific that I will never return to that ER for fear of coming into contact with him again.  

I am writing this review in hopes that others will read this and steer clear of Dr. Sciascia, if at all possible.  If you want to be treated like a human being, find another doctor.  Further, as a doctor myself (not an MD), I am a strong advocate for those who may not have the knowledge, access, or resources to go up against a physician.  

This is NOT over.  

Thank you for reading.",1.0,0,2
"I had this place talked up to me, but I honestly thought it verged on gross food, except the sourdough bread.

Just waited at this Denny's for 30-45mins. They seated us at a table that wasn't even cleaned yet. Then we sat for 10-15mins. without anyone coming over to get our drink order.

"I recently found out what Kung-fu Necktie means. If you stay at the bar long enough, the bartender might even tell you too. Actually, they're only allowed to tell 5 people every night. It's worth it.*

It's an intimate bar, not small by any means, but just large enough to comfortably fit 60 people or so. The lights are always dim and if you need a place to rest your bum, you might be lucky enough to snag a booth. The entire bar was gutted and remodeled by the owner apparently. Respect. 

The cozy patio is a welcome respite for smokers, and you're sure to find the tight pants folk in full supply. When it's open (which I think is often), the upstairs art gallery hosts an array of local and regional art. By regional, I really mean NY. 

With the EL tracks running right over the bar, there's no excuse not to get here. So do it, do it, do it.

"Interestingly, the reviews of this place seem split between people who LUV this place and people who have had terrible customer service experiences. I'm here to say that the cupcakes are actually just bad. Like, you're paying nearly $4 for something that's not much better than a supermarket cupcake - bad. The flavors are artificial-tasting, the frosting has that bad, greasy feel - like shortening, not butter, and the filling for the cupcake I had (coconut flakes on white frosting, pink cake, red goo inside) tasted horrible, like artificial fruit gel. I tried three different types of cupcake from this place, the fruity one, a chocolate on chocolate, and the s'mores. They were all kinda gross. If you actually care about quality baked goods, stay away.",1.0,0,0
"I ate here as a member of a 12 person bachelor party. We ordered almost everything on the menu and the majority of the food was unreal. Oddly enough the worst part of my meal was my filet mignon. I ordered it medium and it was under cooked and over-seasoned. The seafood was top notch and the side dishes were excellent. I'm giving this review 2 stars because at the time our check was to be presented we were told by our waitress (we had almost a dozen people waiting on us) that the bill had been taken care of by an anonymous person earlier in the day. Everyone at the table heard the waitress say this and no one could figure out who would've picked up a $2,600 meal. The next day the grooms credit card was charged for the meal because of the staffs mistake. After weeks of arguing, the restaurant took care of the bill but I still feel as if this is an unacceptable mistake.",2.0,0,1
"There's no place like home, there's no place like home!!! I have now stayed at the Bearigny Suites 6 times, and each time just gets better and better. I have taken short trips for the weekend and even stayed as long as a week. Over our visits we have stayed in all 3 suites and they are all fantastic!!! Matt is amazing and having the owners on site is always a huge plus in my book. From the moment we checked in we felt like we were old friends and coming back home. 

Since my first stay in 2011 I have returned numerous times. I relocated to New Orleans in 2013 and the worst part about living here is not being able to stay at The Bearigny.

"We stayed for a week at the Omni Royal and it was a great place to stay.  Centrally located in the French Quarter, so everything was completely walkable.  The rooms were really nice, the beds very soft, the showers hot and with great water pressure.  There is a heated pool on the roof and an exercise room.  It's a very classy place with excellent service.  The maids were constantly knocking on our door to clean the room, turn down the beds, replace food in the fridge.  The bell porter was available, friendly and helpful, and the front desk folks were great. 

I wasn't entirely keen on the Rib Room restaurant, being that I'm a vegetarian.  But the drinks were fine, and really you should be seeing the city rather than staying in your hotel the whole time anyway.  

Also, if you become a member of their Omni customer program (which is free), you get free internet and cookies.  So just do it.",5.0,2,2

"I went here for Memorial Day and was, frankly, underwhelmed.  The best thing I had was the wine, and I really wished I remembered the name of it.

We started off with the shrimp toast which was quite tasty.  Toast, shrimp, seemed as though it was all fried together but really light and crunchy.  We also had the stuffed mussles.  There were breadcrumbs and maybe a little cream, I think, but that was the extent of the stuffed-ness.

As another snack, I had the crab claws.  For goodness sakes, can a girl just get some marinated crab claws in this city?!  They were battered and fried which is a total mistake for this place.  I just really felt it could've gone a completely different direction.  The really sad part is that the fry was so heavy, you couldn't even taste the crab.  What a waste.  For my entree, I had the special of fish with white bean puree.  The fish was really nicely cooked, but it was covered in avocado and I wasn't really prepared for that.  The honey had the crawfish gratin which he really liked.  Looked like something out of Gremlins if you ask me.  

The whole thing was meh.  Bland, I feel like.  They've talked this place up with all the travel-inspired seasonings and flavors.  It was all lost on me, sadly.  And that chef Tom Colicchio was there that night.  I had to wonder if he thought this place was brilliant or average like I thought it was.  Likely not going back.",2.0,0,2

"Finding a good restaurant with vegan options in a new town can be difficult. Siam Elephant was intriguing and within walking distance from our hotel, so we decided to give it a try. 

Siam Elephant is a Thai restaurant, which raised some concerns for me as someone with severe peanut allergies. In addition, I'm vegan, so the customer service would be put to a test. 

We alerted the waiter that I had a peanut allergy in addition to my vegan diet, and asked if any dishes could be altered to suit me. The waiter told us that they could practically do anything, and we went on with our order. He was very helpful while we ordered, as he listed each non-vegan ingredient in each dish and asked us if we wanted to substitute or take it out. The overall ordering experience was pleasant, as he was very thorough in making sure we knew what each dish contained. 

When the food arrived, the true test began. I had seen reviews about the restaurant being insensitive to allergies, which worried me. Whenever I consume any food I am allergic to, I immediately get a reaction. Ready to grab my epi-pen, I took my first bite of the Spicy Noodle dish... And I let out a huge sigh of relief.

The foods were exactly as we had ordered. Everything was vegan, meat subbed with tofu, with no trace of a peanut in sight. Confident in the food, I dug in and devoured most of the meal.

The actual flavors of the food were delicious. Everything was well-balanced and seasoned nicely. The Spicy Noodle dish was delicious with the mix of hot rice noodles and bell peppers. The special at the time, Tempura Avocado, was also delicious and I'd recommend to anyone that likes avocados to snatch it if available. The Coconut soup was also extremely good, not to mention the overall presentation. 

Pro Tip for vegans/lactose intolerants: the Thai Tea Boba comes with half-and-half. However, just alert the waiter about your veganism/intolerance and ask to sub for coconut milk. Tastes just as good!

Overall, the experience here was gosh-darn amazing and it would be my first choice if I ever returned. I recommend it to anybody, as there are so many versatile options that the waiters are willing to tweak.",5.0,2,2

"I think it's a good place to go if you want big, floppy, yummy pizza.  I tried the spinach and artichoke (Garlic, Parmesan, Olives, Provolone Cheese & White Sauce) and I liked it for all its juicy goodness.  Every bite is so rich, buttery, and cheesy that it's hard to stop.  I also tried the Pepper Pie (Peppadews, Jalepenos, Poblano Peppers, Crumbled Hot Sausage, Mozzarella & Red Sauce) and I love the flavors of the spices mixed with the sweet sauce.  It's about $18 for a huge 16"" which ends up not being too bad since the slices are so rich and filling.

I had a 10 beer flight, figuring that would be one of the best ways to sample all the beers.  Quite a few things were out and although I said ""no IPAs"" because I'm not a fan of them, I wound up with all the IPAs and not many of the other things.  So, not listening.  Tried all the beers and found exactly one that I wanted more of.

I flagged someone down to order food...slow service.  I figured a nice fish and chips would be good and I got my beer.  My fish and chips arrived and the fish was raw in the middle.  It looked like it had come out of the freezer, into the deep fryer and just didn't get cooked through.  Obviously that went back and they brought me another one...exactly the same.  Cook in the back needs to know this, don't just keep bringing me more of the same.  That went back and I got a Ruben, which was pretty good, although the corned beef was a bit chewy.  The bartender gave me a free beer for my trouble, but nothing was comped on my bill.

Off my list for food.  I think the reasons are pretty convincing.  I might go back over for that beer since it's the only thing in walking distance to the hotel I was staying at, but not having to drive after a few beers is the only endorsement I can offer here.  Maybe try some other food that you can't really mess up...?",2.0,0,1

"I am consistently disappointed with this spa. I continue to come back here because I love Seminole Heights and I want to support our local businesses. 

Today, I had a bikini wax and pedicure scheduled at 10am. I called on Wednesday to have it scheduled. I walked in to find the staff setting up the spa and everyone looking at me like I wasn't expected. Then, the woman who I assume is the owner, told me they couldn't get ahold of the ""bikini waxer"". I wouldn't be so irritated, but they had just called me yesterday to remind me of my appointment.
She then told me she could ""attempt to do it"". No, I do not want you to attempt to do my bikini wax. When I declined, she said she just hadn't done one in a long time. 

From facials to pedicures, this place has always disappointed. This will be the last time I try to support this business. 

I would like to say, the staff, although there seems to be an incredibly high turnover rate, is always the nicest.",1.0,0,0

"I really like dancing at Koresh and I'm so happy to have found them right here in center city!

I'm definitely a dancer... I've been dancing most of my life, throughout college, and also taught dance for many years so I'm no stranger to the studio. With that being said, it's hard to find a studio that's conveniently located that has classes which aren't all ""beginner ballet for adults"". (Which is awesome, but not for me!)

So here's Koresh... They offer not only the beginner level classes for the newbies but they also accommodate the more advanced and professional dancers with classes like Tap (my fave), Modern Jazz (Shannon M is awesome!) Ballet, and Hip Hop.

They've recently moved to 20th & Rittenhouse and the space is really nice. It's below street level so there's no windows which may or may not be a sweaty, muggy, mess next summer.

Basically, if you're a dancer over the age of 15 and you're at any stage in your dance training, you can find a class at Koresh.",4.0,2,2
"The location is excellent.  I also love the layout of the restaurant.  The wait staff was very nice and responsive.  The garlic rolls were very good, but not impressed with the steamed mussels or the calamari.  My meal was good, but not great.  I had a seafood angel hair pasta.  Fresh pasta would have been much better for a true Italian place.  The sauce was okay, but again not really creamy or rich enough for a true Italian meal.  The bread pudding was average for the area.  I think this place has potential but they have more in ambiance versus the food.",3.0,1,1

"My girlfriend and I first found this place under it's previous name, Amrutha. Back then it was shrouded in curtains with dimmed lighting inside. The restaurant has changed since then.

The last time we visited with my parents from out of town, we all had a great meal. The food at Curry leaf remains the best Indian food I've ever had. I'm pretty certain that the food is made by an Indian family that runs the place. I especially like their palak paneer and chicken biryani rice, however chicken tika masala is also excellent. Whenever I visit I order chai at the end of the meal, it's friggin' amazing, it's like drinking a cookie.

If this were a review of Amrutha it would be five stars, however the restaurant is now too bright(they removed the curtains and didn't replace them with anything, eating at sundown can be somewhat annoying) and the young white college girl waitress they hired is somewhat awkward and impatient. 

Though the new staff and atmosphere subtracts a star the food is still amazing, I recommend this place to everyone who comes into town.",4.0,2,2
"The best part about this place is the huge portions. Other than that, it has certainly gone downhill.

"This place is awesome! I have always put off reviewing the place because it's hard to put into words how well my husband and I have been treated every time we have dined in the establishment. 

This was our ""date place"" when we dated long distance. I would look forward to having a delicious meal and several desserts! We would get the roasted veggie entree(Checking the menu now, it appears that the entree has changed slightly, but still sounds damn good!), which was always perfect and was varied by the seasons. Of course, we LOVED the desserts. Most of them were made in-house, and presented beautifully. Creme brulee or bread pudding, paired with an Irish coffee were the perfect finish to a great meal. 

When we dine here, we show up early, go to the back courtyard bar, and bask in the great service while waiting for our table. I loved the bartender's knowledge of wines and beers, and I would often go out of my comfort zone (whiskey) and try something new! I was never dissapointed. 

I also planned an event here, my wedding brunch. My family was extremely impressed and enjoyed everything. We were showered with free champagne, compliments, and excellent service. We were able to all order exactly what we wanted, and the waitress quietly ensured that we did not go over our price range (we were about to get married, and slightly broke due to it), and made sure that my mother's dietary concerns were met. The event planner was polite, helpful, and answered all my neurotic questions quickly.

Close the the beach and close enough to state street.  We stayed in a king room with jacuzzi and fireplace.  It was very nice.  They also have continental breakfast.

"So I traveled for miles and way out of my way just to get a Salted Bagel with Lox, and of course the awesome Coffee Einsteins has.
So first off I'm very disappointed that at 10:30 am they don't have any Salted Bagels. Really that's your big seller! I highly doubt it..Second disappointment is when I sit down I notice that there is white onions on the Bagel and Lox when there should be Red onions or what I know them as Bermuda Onions. I mean yeah it's defiantly a good sandwich and the Lox is Fresh and non fatty and the sesame bagel is fantastic
by this point I solderer through it and take the nasty Onions off after a couple of bites.

"For starters, my sister called the restaurant after we got back from her graduation on Sunday to ask last-minute if they could accommodate our large party of 8 (three sisters, two boyfriends, mom, dad and grandma). Fortunately, they didn't hesitate to take us, even though it was rather late. 

The Excellent: the food! Oh my god, the food! Everything that I had was perfectly seasoned. Our table had the three spreads with pita, the grilled octopus (not rubbery, perfectly tender and seasoned), I shared a cheese plate with someone (REALLY good selections, good portions, accoutrements were AWESOME, especially the truffle honey and red onion marmalade), and the seared foie gras and scallop. All were FANTASTIC. My main course was the Pasta special: fettuccine with spinach, shittake mushrooms, grilled shrimp in a truffle sauce that was slightly creamy. So good! My sister and her boyfriend got the paella for two, and others' got either a mix of tapas and one person got the fish entree. Everything came out at the same time, and at the right temp. Desserts were sorbets (eh... nothing special, just sorbets), the quad of Creme Brulees, and the Oreo Beignets. In order of greatness to mediocrity: creme brulees were good. I say good and not great because the Vanilla Mint could have had more mint flavor, and most were a little undercooked (even for me, a pastry chef. And I hate overdone CBs, but if there is TOO much liquid center, it gets a little gross). The sorbets were standard, but good. There isn't really a whole lot you can do with sorbet. I was really disappointed about the beignets. They were overly greasy, and not really flavorful. They had a smoky aftertaste which hints that the oil used to fry them was old. Granted we dined at the end of the night, but that was a really shoddy job. Wine selection was great. I had a Vallani-Vixen, one of their ""Frou-frou"" drinks. It was incredible. All in all, good marks on food: flavor, temperature, consistency, 

The only bad: the service. Granted, as a pastry cook who has worked for 4 years in good restaurants, I understand the business. The restaurant anticipated about 40-50 people on a rainy Sunday night. That sounds pretty standard. The manager told me they got nearly 140. That's a HUGE gap, but then again, they could not have really anticipated that. So service was slow. Our waitress definitely needed to be more present, but she definitely kept our wine glasses full, or drinks served as needed, and water poured consistently. 

Overall, this is definitely a dining experience to have. I would recommend reservations in advance, try a smaller group, and maybe go earlier in the evening on a slow day (try 530 on a Monday or Tuesday) to have the best experience possible (but that advice goes for all restaurants, really)",4.0,2,2

"Absolutely horrible take out experience. Since today is Thanksgiving it is understandable that specials, to include lunch, would not be offered. Not many restaurants are open downtown therefore this presents an ideal capitalistic opportunity.  Despite the higher dinner prices we paid for cheaper lunch items, the wait was approximately 20 minutes which would have also been understandable if there were anyone else in the restaurant. We were their ONLY customers at the time.  After growing increasingly impatient and heading toward the register, a lady cones out with our order. We pay and continue our hike back to our hotel. Upon sitting down to enjoy our food we realize that an item was missing. Instead of the shrimp rolls ordered, we received what looked to be vegetable tempura. Deep fried sweet potatoes, broccoli, etc and one fried shrimp. We promptly called the restaurant to express our discontent. The lady answering the phone, apparently the same one who packaged the order emphatically asserted that not only did we get what we ordered but also they would never have charged us for shrimp rolls since they were ""out of shrimp""! This is wrong on many levels but nonetheless we wanted a replacement item. We don't like Tempura. On the phone the lady agreed to replace our dish and we proceeded to drive back to the restaurant. At the restaurant door, my wife was confronted by another employee who stated ""we don't do refunds"" before even explaining the problem. She also pointed to the lonely shrimp in the container and declared ""see we told you we don't have rolls but we have a combo and that's what you ordered"". Huh? First off, how is it a combo if you have no shrimp to combine? Second, if you have no shrimp then why is this lonely guy in our take out box? After a short discussion my wife chose the papaya salad and they made her order quickly.  I believe they also realized their errors in communication and gave my wife a free Thai iced tea. 

The point of the story is that the food overall was substandard (pad Thai was dry). Prompt service did not exist and lastly, customer service was at the lowest I've seen.  I will not visit this establishment in the future and advise that if you are in the mood for Thai food on State st, save your money and go elsewhere.",1.0,0,0

I suggest the Calamari for an appetizer and the Mushroom Pizza with fontina cheese and truffle oil was very delicious as well. They have some pretty different menu items that are not for the faint of heart. I definitely want to go back to try the Smelts, the Lasagna Cupcake, and the Crab Cannoli.

Disappointed again.  We went back the other day for the early bird special, all was nice, but the quality of the food was not a good as it should be.  I doubt we'll ever be back.

Mar. 2016
We went back today and we were highly disappointed....

1.  Upon being seated, we observed that the place was almost full AND the noise-level was so loud, that it was nearly impossible to have a conversation without shouting at each other.  There is no sound absorption anywhere in the restaurant.....very annoying.

2.  We were advised that the Tuesday all-day ""Early Bird"" special has been discontinued.....so much for saving a buck.

3.  We both ordered the Blackened Chicken Alfredo,  The chicken was cubed and hardly blackened, also very bland with no taste.  It had an excessive amount of Alfredo sauce.

4.  We were offered garlic bread, but the waitress never mentioned that it was an additional charge.  Four pieces of garlic bread was $3.90.  A rip....

We don't expect to be back anytime in the future.

Yes, the clothing is second hand, but nearly everything I've seen on the racks is in great condition.

This store can definitely be hit or miss, but that's typical when shopping at this kind of store. You have to thumb through the racks to find items that you like.

As soon as the waiter went inside he put his arm round his shoulder and had a long chat, after which our waiter finally made eye contact with us after the meal was over and insisted giving us a free dessert, which my friend took home.  The food was about the best one could find in this Southshore area.  The outside seating area is better since the inside is dilapidated at best and the drinks are watered down.  The tiki bar makes better drinks.  I have a gorgeous sunset at my home so I don't go there for that.  It's all about the food and service.  Both of which are lacking and getting progressively worse.  My husband and I went for our 37th anniversary this past week and sat outside.  We requested an umbrella of a passing waiter and he said NO emphatically that we couldn't have one.  I went to talk to the manager, who informed me that they no longer have umbrellas for tables and btw who was the waiter and assured me he wouldn't get into trouble.  Since the 2 managers seemed to act like I was interrupting them (they were idle when I went into the office) and was a nuisance I told them we usually spend at least $75-$100 - he didn't care. In fact he suggested we go to Circles.  I won't eat there as they've had 3 dirty dining reports in the under 2 years I've resided here.  I told him no thank you for your suggestion and we then went to Hooks.  This idiot did us a huge favor the food was far superior.  There was shade outside and it is also on the water.  The servers were most pleasant and professional.  The only drawback is plasticware and paper plates.  I certainly can overlook that shortcoming for such delicious, perfectly prepared food.  We had coconut shrimp, gator bites and shared a burger.  I've had the shrimp and burger at Sunset Grille and it pales in comparison to Hooks.  I suspect that these managers think that because they're on the water and many customers are visiting they don't care about improving their attitude and food.  I wonder what tune they'll be singing out of season.  I've told many others my experience and they too will not be going there again.  Too bad they don't respect their local customers.",1.0,0,0
"I am torn on Fresh Market.  On one hand, they have amazing specials - both weekly and one day only - on everything from produce to fresh meat to their prepared items.  On the other hand, I could never use this as my main grocery or we would go broke and I'd still have to go other places for everything on my list.  If I rate them for their usefulness as a one-stop shop, they are a solid two star.  If I rate them as I would a specialty grocer like a vegetable or meat market, they are a four star.  So let's cut the difference and say three star.  The staff in the meat department is always cheerful even when overrun by deal seekers.  Their produce is quiet good, though I don't care so much if the offerings are organic or not.  I have also been pleased with some of the shelf stable offerings from specialty olive oils to simmer sauces to pastas.  My one major complaint is that there is always a long wait to check out as they never seem to have enough cashiers for their volume of customers.",3.0,1,2
"About a month ago, I was in a messed up situation! My car was knocking at my door smh , I was so confused and didn't know where to turn. Anyway thanks to Wayne and mike, they took care of everything and got my car back up and running. Pretty fast too! 
Very reliable too, cause a week ago I needed some work done on a time frame, and mike made sure my car was ready before that. I'll definitely recommend these guys for any auto repair.
Thank again for everything!
Keep on doing what your doing!

"Discovered this gem while looking for brunch places that wouldn't be super crowded. 417 Union couldn't have been more perfect. It is quaint and has a southern diner feel. I had our waitress (Dre - who was fantastic) help me decide between 2 dishes. She recommended ""Rachel's Open Faced Inside Out Burger"" and oh my was she right. Hands down one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Tons of flavor, which is mainly credit to their homemade Boursin cheese stuffed inside. The side of fries was average, but I am actually thankful because it left more room for the burger. The staff was friendly and welcoming, especially our waitress, Dre, who I mentioned before. Highly recommend this place!!",4.0,2,2
"I was working in South Philly today and decided I wanted to go out for lunch. So naturally, I used my trusty Yelp app and looked up some local places. San Miguelito popped up at the top of my list, had a 5 star rating and was a 7 minute walk from my job. Perfect! 
This restaurant was definitely a diamond in the rough. The food that this little hole in the wall was putting out was amazing! I ordered the Al Pastor tacos, which were served on fresh tortillas with cilantro and onions. The meat was juicy, flavorful, authentic and cooked to perfection.  Yum yum yum yum yum! An order of 3 only came to $6.50!!!!! This restaurant is a little hole in the wall and I would have never thought about coming in here. Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find this gem. Another successful food adventure! I hope after you read this you make the decision to try this place out too. You will not be disappointed.",5.0,2,2

If you are headed out to a Bucs game Al Lopez Park is the place to well...park. For $15 you get a nice grassy area to park on and you get access to the park bathrooms!! No porta-potty here. Located on the NW corner of MLK and Himes this lot isn't a bad walk to the stadium and it is so much easier to exit than some of the larger lots closer to the stadium. If you are looking for a fun tailgate spot try this location out.,5.0,2,2
"Excellent service. Had an awesome bartender Stacey who was very attentive, had a great conversation and offered some awesome drink suggestions that we tried (shock top with gran marnier).

"One of the best Philly cheese steaks I've ever had, and with a side of perfectly-seasoned fries. Good music nights. Lovely deck. Many southside bars tend to feel fairly cold to me, and often have bright office lighting instead of warm bar lighting. The Corner Bar's warm lighting and thoughtful layout feel great. Folks there have been quite friendly and welcoming--it seems easy to become part of the community. Excellent staff and service. I've been there ten or more times since I was turned on to the place. I expect to become a regular. And, did I mention the cheese steak?!!",5.0,2,2
"If you want a true Philadelphia experience with people that keep it real, then this is the place for you. Mariel the bartender/manager will make you want to come back again. The wings were delicious and I never waited for a drink. Would love to come back and try the cheesesteak. I over heard another customer say they were amazing. Thanks, Mariel for a great time!",5.0,2,2

"You know when you come across a place and are all excited and you bookmark it for just the right time.  That's how Pour House was for me, I excitedly bookmarked it, there were so many things I wanted on the menu, namely the oysters, but I was waiting for the right time to come.  My first visit was a little over a year ago, I had a really good time, food was great, my only complaint was that it was cold and loud.  Being on a date it made it a little difficult to communicate especially because I have a fairly soft voice.  However, all in all it was a great time.  
My most recent visit earlier this week, it wasn't cold, yay.. but it was still loud, this time though we weren't as bothered since we have been on plenty dates in plenty environments.  We came in on a Wednesday for Buck-a-Shuck oysters, I anticipated a crowd and a wait... we were told 25 minutes, the downstairs bar was full so we headed upstairs to the smaller bar.  The bartender, didn't catch her name, was a sweetheart, the guy next to us was cool, it was nice talking to him and literally as soon as we got our drinks the buzzer went off our table was ready.  He finished his 120 minute IPA and I brought my Dark Swan with me to our table.  We both enjoyed our drinks and the bar service.  
While at the bar we had got into a convo about wings, their hot wings had been thrown into the mix so we decided to try them.  We also ordered oysters (blue point) there were at least 6 to choose from with the descriptions of each which I though was awesome because I can never remember which I prefer, but with the descriptions it made it all the more easy to go straight for the taste I was looking for.  The wings were really good as were the oysters.  I had put in for the shaved rib-eye sandwich and him the burger plain well done with fries.  Burger came out cooked as requested and delicious.. and My sandwich was awesome as well.  I would probably opt for the bbq sauce on the side next time, it paired nicely with it, but I'm very particular about the amount of sauce used. I would definitely get it again with no hesitation, the bun, meat, cheese, everything about it was delicious.  I opted to stick with the chips it came with rather than upgrade to the fries, as much as I love French fries, that was actually the right amount of food, not overkill.  
All in all I really enjoy coming to the Pour House, the parking lot makes for easy parking.  The menu has pretty interesting items on it, still quite a few I need to try.  Staff is nice and accommodating.  The beer menu is on point, I think each time we've found something new to add to what we now drink.  They are open late...and it's pretty close so that's a plus too.  I'll def be back.",4.0,2,2

"I love the product this company makes. Although I had to wait a long time for my door and gate to be created; it is beautiful. I must say that I was not very fond of the salesperson I worked with, Michael. He was great the first time he came out. Was polite, answered all my questions and took time with me. However, after the sale was made each contact, I had with him left me feeling like I was bothering him. I had a unique situation with a gate and felt like he was talking down to me. Also, the person that came to deliver and set up my door and gate was a bit frustrating. I have a light right by the door and his comment was I can take the light off the wall to install the door but can't put it back on. What? I told him, I can't reinstall that and we need to find a way to install without removing the light. A half hour later he had the door installed and apparently the light was not an issue.  I wish he would have held this comment versus freaking me out that he would not do the install after waiting 3 months for the product. I would like to order future doors for my back and side of the house but will not work with this company again mainly due to how I felt with the sales rep and the installation.",3.0,1,2
"This place drives me absolutely insane. I want to love it but for everything they do incredibly well they do something that disappoints. Last night was a perfect example of my usual experience. The ambiance is fantastic and the large wooden bar and decor is great. Unfortunately, the service is always uneven with the most common issue being grumpy server/bartenders. The food is just as erratic. The burger is always perfectly cooked and scrumptious but last night the potato strings were barely luke warm. While the burger was fantastic the pasta with ""chorizo"" was also luke warm and the ""chorizo"" tasted absolutely nothing like any chorizo ive ever eaten. It tasted more like a bland Italian sausage and the pasta sauce had an odd flavor to it. When the server asked if we wanted a box to take it home we said no and that it was't very good. I wasn't looking for a comp but i guess i was looking for something other than him completely ignoring our feedback and walking away. Our group also though the fried pickle appetizer had a funky taste. 

All that being said, ill still continue to eat here in hopes that the servers will start to smile and  that the food quality will improve. I know they can do it as their burgers, pork chops, scallops and brunch are fantastic. So many good things and just enough missteps to make you crazy.",3.0,1,2

"being a quarter vietnamese, I've had my share of Pho, from my mother's home made pho, to my wifes home made pho, ive had pho in Hawaii, pho in Florida, pho in NYC, pho in New Mexico, pho in Kentucky, pho in central PA, pho in South Jersey Atlantic City area, and of course in Philly. pho is all about the broth, I know a good broth when I taste it, if it's real or it's fake. though not the best bowl of Pho I've ever had, but for being in lower bucks county area, with almost zero competition, this will surely satisfy your pho craving.
its great if you're sick, and arguably the best hang over medicine after a long night of adult beverages.
This place is brand new, thought I would try it out since I live in Yardley, I am glad I did, I dont have to drive all the way in to Philly for a decent bowl of pho now. I definitely will be coming back. if youre a pho'natic like me, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",4.0,2,2
"Ok, for $28, the chirashi bowl is probably 4.5-stars: 16 pieces of fish, all fresh, all good to very good quality, sushi rice, plus some seaweed and tsukemono...and you get a choice of green salad or miso soup.  That's enough on its own to fill me up most nights.  Suzuki (striped bass) was fantastic!

I sat at the sushi bar and saw a lot of the rolls being made, and would agree with complaints from other reviewers that mentioned too much sauce, and vis-à-vis the chirashi, I just don't see the value at $13 - $15 per roll.  Still, if you're not quite ready for raw fish without all the sauces and veggies to hide it, I don't think rolls here would be a *bad* choice, just not for me.  

BYOB is a nice perk, service is friendly, and they serve complimentary fruit for dessert but with a tasty non-standard addition of banana tempura.

"First of all, I have to say that Juans is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The food is great, the drinks are good, and service is usually pretty good.  And I say usually because I have had problems several times recently with a particular bartender.  I typically eat here about once a week, and I'm usually alone.  When it's busy, I'll eat at the bar in order to leave a table open for a larger party...but recently if I see this particular bartender I'll sit at a table just so I don't have to deal with her.  I'm sure you'll recognize her when you see her.  She has tattoos all over her chest and usually wears skirts that are way too revealing.  She's unbearably rude not only to customers, but also to her fellow employees.  She has messed up my drink order many times (salt on my margarita when I say no salt...lime on my Negro Modelo when I say no lime), but I just deal with it because I don't want to have to deal with her snide remarks and rude looks.  She seems to think nothing is ever her fault, and her attitude to her own coworkers is atrocious.  At my job, I'd be fired if I spoke to my coworkers the way she speaks to hers.  So now I just go the other way when I see her working the bar (thank god I've never seen her working as a server or else I would walk out the restaurant immediately).

But enough about terrible bartenders.  I will now speak to my good experience.  The servers are typically very nice and engaging, and I can understand slow service sometimes when the restaurant is packed (although many times my food is ready within 10 minutes).  The food is always great -- I recommend the pork and slaw tacos and the Western Burritos.

Overall, I recommend Juans as a good neighborhood place.  The prices are great, the food is awesome, and I love the margaritas...just as long as a particular bartender is not making it or serving it to me directly.",3.0,1,2

I didn't try anything too interesting, just their grilled chicken sandwich with fries. Perhaps years of corporate microwaved chicken has lowered my standards a bit, but the sandwich was basic and good. The fries were crisp and fresh. The best aspects of their menu seem fixated around breakfast, so I need to try that and edit this review. Overall, I felt I was getting local, fresh ingredients prepared competently. But that's all. There was nothing particularly interesting about it or what I saw on their lunch menu. I'd prefer this over places like Logan's because of their focus on local produce (and it's not a franchise), but it really isn't that much more interesting.",4.0,2,1

My first oil change on my 2020 tundra after I left the steering wheel started rattling out of no where. It wasnt doing this when I bought it. I had to go to Toyota 4 times. They fought me tooth and nail that it's not a warranty issue. As soon as they looked at the truck they got quite and said it was under warranty and fixed ASAP.

"so I have the yelp app for my iPhone because I constantly use it to read and check out reviews of the places I may go to, and I don't want to waste my money and be disappointed. I have never written a review, but I went out of my way to make an account so I could write this review and share my opinion. 

I have NEVER been so disappointed with a BBQ place as I have with roseys. the first time I ever went, they had just opened so I decided to give them a shot since they're much closer to my house than sweet lucys. I got ribs, mac n cheese, and sweet potato mash. the cashier, I assume he was a manager or something, was talking up the food so much I had high expectations. well it was very underwhelming .. the ribs had an unpleasant porky smell, were dry, and not enough sauce at all to help conceal the dryness. the mac n cheese tasted like mushy cheese bc it didn't have the random little burnt edges I LOVE from sweet lucys, and the sweet potatoes were too liquidy and had random chunks. I was so let down:(

a couple months later a friend and I were starving and craving BBQ, she did not want to drive far so I decide we should go to roseys, maybe they could redeem themselves and maybe improved with time right? I was wrong.. this time I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with home made chips, and she ordered ribs and some sides. first off- the pulled pork did not have enough sauce AGAIN if it even had any in the first place and no BBQ smokey flavor, the slaw was too watery it dripped everywhere and made my bread disgustingly soggy, and then the worst part was the chips. don't get me wrong, I love home made chips, but they gave me a bad batch. they were obviously stale, and I had my friend try one to see if maybe I'm delusional. she spit it out and agreed they were really, really really stale and way too much seasoning. she was so mad at me for suggesting roseys bc of my terrible food and she was not happy with hers. her ribs had so much squishy fat on it she only ate a couple bites on each. it was very unfair and disappointing to have to pay for low quality, and some old food. I haven't been back since and don't know if I ever will. it's not right to ever serve old food. seeing the reviews on here that people left make me think: maybe I went on an off day since some people had great experiences. but two for two doesn't sit well with me and has scarred me enough to write this in the first place. I want everyone to know my experience so they don't have to have one like mine. 

my friend and I unfortunately went somewhere else to get good food right after we left roseys- spending twice the amount of money for one meal. absolutely wonderful. never ever again.",1.0,0,0
"Went to this restaurant this past Saturday for a friend's birthday. Always wanted to try this place, but hadn't made it in yet. We had a pretty big group, at about 15. The service level was first-rate, the drinks (mint ginger vodka) was off the chain, and the food was epic. 

Espresso Prime Strip was excellent. Thick, tender, juicy and with a ridiculous flavor.

Straight Bacon - best bacon I've ever had, ever. And I work for a meat company and have sold bacon before. I ended up ordering two of these. 

Our server, I think his name was Rich, was awesome. Funny, intelligent, genuine, and very accommodating. 

Will definitely be coming back here often.",5.0,2,2

"Bad is an understatement...
Wow.
We arrived about 5:30am, exhausted from driving 3,000 miles... No one was there, only a sign with a number to call... Someone answered and said ""I'll be there in a little bit"" Um.. That turned in to about a 20 minute wait.
The guy was snarky at best, and each encounter with him was dim...
As far as the room. well...
Bloody Mattresses, BOTH of the 2 Mattresses had blood stains on them + The pillows had stains as well of blood. Looks like someone was possibly stabbed to death.
The floor was GROSS. There was even a random toe nail!!! Clearly not cleaned in between who knows how many guests...
The light above the sink was broken (all we had was the bathroom light to use, DIM)
Gave a smoking room when we requested non smoking room.
WE had to beg for 4 towels for 4 people...

THEY WOULD NOT GIVE EVEN A SLIGHT DISCOUNT....
DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE!!! YOU WILL BE SAD YOU DID!!!",1.0,0,0
"This place was a pretty average place to get sushi. The food here wasn't outstanding, it was just so-so. But it's a good place for you if you're craving sushi pretty late at night. The salad was pretty tasty--I liked the dressing on it (not sure what it was though). I had the Ladies' Set (I kinda take issue with the name but oh well), which includes 3 choices of handrolls. They were good, but not the best I'd ever had.

All the sushi combinations come with mochi as dessert, which they forgot to give us until we reminded them. But that isn't a big deal. Overall, this is your average sushi restaurant, and a place to visit should you find yourself having late night sushi cravings.",3.0,1,1
"I've never knew there was a Thai place in Northern Liberties and I was super happy that I found out about Bann Thai. The dining area gives off a super casual/good vibe atmosphere which I appreciate. 

I came here on date had an amazing time from the conversation to the dining experience. First, this place is BYOB so be sure to bring in a good pairing of your choice. There's a Wine and Spirits within walking distance that is highly recommended to stop in prior to dining.

Okay back to Baan Thai! The waitress ""Pum"" was great. She was attentive, helpful, gave great relationship advice and also gave us space to converse amongst one another. The food was solid! I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, which was tasty and my date ordered the Green Curry. The green curry sauce was little thin but other than that, no complaints. The food came out hot and flavorful. 

So why the 5 star?!? During dinner, my date spilled her glass of water all over my lap. I know, smooth. The staff was incredible, they swiftly stepped in, found us another table and cleaned up the spill without any fuss or attitude. Remarkable customer service!! That alone is the reason for the 5 star rating. Would definitely go on another date with this cutie for more Thai deliciousness!",5.0,2,2
"Who doesn't love brunch??! The wait here wasn't too bad especially when we put our names down in the yelp waitlist. We waited around 15 minutes at 11am on Saturday. Totally doable if you ask me. The plaza also has a inexplicably big bed bath and beyond that you can waste some time at all. 

Front desk staff was friendly. Theres the standard menu and a monthly special menu that contains very cheeky, cute names for some of their limited time offerings. Things like Im coming Out pancakes for pride month, which I completely regret not getting. My friend I went with is trying this whole gluten free lifestyle this year sooo i forgo-ed the french toast out of respect and got the wild mushroom frittata instead. I also got a pathetic side of bacon(see picture) and my friend got the quevos rancheros. Food was fresh, but not anything too special. I just enjoyed the quality of the food, staff, and non-stuff atmosphere. Would recommend for a laid back brunch with friends.",3.0,1,2

I went here last week with my fiance as he saw this on a place that will check out in Tampa Bay. Overall I walked into the plant it is definitely not what I imagine thinking of a British pub. It had a much nicer aesthetic and was much bigger than I thought. This place can get packed on the nights when there is a Lightning game so keep that in mind. Our server was nice and accommodating. Since my fiance and I have been dieting we decided to eat as much as we could so we tried a variety of the foods there. We started off with the Piccadilly Spears which I actually really liked but I'm a huge fan of fried pickle. Nice salty pickles and the crust was very crispy. Next up we tried to the Scotch egg and the spicy bacon mac and cheese. The thing with the Scotch egg is that what I've had in the past it's been hot and the outside was a little warm but the inside was cold but it was pretty good. Spicy mac and cheese with also pretty good but not the best Mac and Cheese I've ever tried. I got the Manchester burger and my fiance got the fish and chips. The fries were done to Perfection which is great because that is my favorite food. The Manchester wasn't bad by death we thought I had a lot going on. Definitely a burger not to order active had about 3 appetizer hahaha. My fiance thought the fish and chips were pretty good too. Overall a nice place to visit if you're in the area and the food is pretty good. Nice Lively atmosphere full of tons of people.,4.0,2,2
I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. I only sort of like bbq in the first place but the sides alone were delicious. I had a half rack of ribs and my husband had the smoked sausage.

"Decided on trying this place again after many years, just because we had a gift card that hadn't been used, and it was my wife's birthday.
The pork tenderloin was very tasty, although I couldn't find much in the way of prosciutto. Wife enjoyed her Mezzaluna pasta dish also. Drinks were reasonably priced.
Monday night was not busy at all, judged by the many empty tables, but we felt RUSHED throughout the meal. It seemed we had just received our drinks and bread, when the salad arrived at the table. Both of us were still busy with our salads when the entrees arrived. We were still busy with this, when they were asking whether we wanted dessert, which we declined.

Our server was having a great day which we had excellent service. My Blackened Chicken Pasta was cooked to perfection, and she kept on coming back for our drink refills! We tipped her good. The menu could be better, but i guess that up to the D&B corporation. 

I'm a Huge Fan of the Olympic Games, and this place had full coverage of Men's Basketball, Women's Gymnastics, and Diving (although I'm not the biggest fan of that event, it was still exciting)

"Ordered oxtails, smothered pork chop dinner, & (2) peach cobblers but they only delivered the pork chop.  No issue there because they re-delivered the oxtails dinner & (2) peach cobblers 45 mins later.  Mistakes happen & they took care of it just fine so no reduction of stars for that. 

Where I did deduct stars: 

1. the food was not good AT ALL 

2. pork chop, mashed potatoes, greens - pork chop was overcooked so it was tough & dry, the mashed potatoes were instant & watery, you expect instant mashed potatoes from fast food joints like KFC but not from a ""home cooking soul food"" restaurant & they had zero seasoning - no salt/pepper, greens were okay, had to add my own seasoning, asked for roll but got a dry cornbread muffin 

3. oxtails, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes - oxtails meat was okay but gravy was too salty & it was about 1/4 cup gravy spilled all over bag, watery instant mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes were okay but I've had way better elsewhere & at home 

4. peach cobbler - this is hands down the weirdest tasting peach cobbler I've ever had the misfortune of eating.  It was not sweet at all, I think someone forgot to add sugar, it was overly spiced with nutmeg/cinnamon or whatever they used, peaches were extremely overcooked so they were almost disintegrated, the dough was ?!, idk what was up with the dough, it was thin dark brown & so soggy, could not eat this 

What was inedible:
1. smothered pork chop
2. oxtails
3. (2) instant mashed potatoes
4. cornbread muffin
5. (2) peach cobblers 

What was good:
1. the roll on the oxtails dinner 

What was okay:
1. collard greens
2. sweet potatoes

"For a special occasion, we took a break from the usual fast casual take out spots.  I wasn't sure how ""finer"" dining would work out in to-go containers, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the pork chop, which was cooked really nicely and was still moist when I cut into it at home.  The sauce was very tasty as well - sweet and savory.  We also had a side of brussel sprouts, but they were a little under for my preference.  I was impressed with the dessert.  We had:
1) chocolate mousse with whipped cream delivered in a cup - solid choice
2) almond flour orange cake - lovely flavor and soft fluffy texture.  It came topped with candied orange peel and a side of vanilla ice cream in a separate cup.  I really liked the cake overall and would order again BUT the batter was not well-mixed.  Towards the edge of the slice, I started finding clumps of baking soda, first noticed by the overwhelming saltiness that started pervading the last few bites.  That was unfortunate.
3) macarons - a variety of 6 with a little whipped cream.  They were okay...would not order again because I liked the first two desserts better

Although the menu doesn't indicate allergens, the restaurant is very gluten-free friendly.  My husband called ahead to check and was told the chef personally understood gluten free diets.  That explains the number of available gluten-free desserts and entrees!  I'm glad we tried take out from here and look forward to dining in at some point!",4.0,2,2

This was my first time going here. I passed it lots of time but finally decided to try it out for lunch and I have to say it wasn't that bad.

"A couple of weeks before I went into the store, I read a great summary about it in the eat.shop guide for New Orleans. Completely by chance, I happened to find the store after wandering through the French Quarter. Love the decor! The store is very well organized and not cramped like other boutiques throughout the city. Mind you, my main draw was the several signs posted on the windows blaring ""75% Sale"", which was located in the back of the store (nice selection!). Considering my college student budget (broke-$100), the majority of the items were beyond my price range; but, with names like kensie, BCBGMaxAzria, and a host of others, I couldn't help but peek around. Great staff - they were helpful and social, but not to the point of annoyance, a rare find. I suggest taking a peek in this store to get some gorgeous dresses and casual knits. And yes, I did get some Anlo wide-leg jeans for well under $100, considering they originally cost near $300!",4.0,2,2
"I've eaten here a few times with no complaints. The first time I walked in on a Sunday evening around 17.00 Hrs and was immediately served - there was no line. The second time I ordered online and set a 17.30 hrs. pick up time - I walked up to the counter at 17.25 Hrs and they were just finishing up my order. Both times the staff was pleasant and helpful.
   The quality is better than what one would receive at a Taco Bell but not quite up there with some of the city's more famous Latin inspired eateries. It is priced right for what it is. Portions are plentiful and fresh, though one time they were out of the wheat tortillas. The dining area has been clean on both my visits though the unisex restroom has a funky odor.
   I prefer this place over the nearby Chipotle for two reasons: 1) the loyalty card program (buy 10 and the 11th is free) and 2) sitting upstairs watching Walnut Street pass by.",4.0,2,1
"Surprisingly Disappointing!

We needed a night out, so we decided on PF CHANGS. It's my 7 year old daughter's favorite and one of the few places we can all go and dine as my kids both have food allergies. It was a Sunday evening, so I figured this west end location should be just perfect. We arrived around 6ish, to find a mostly empty restaurant, only to be told that there could be up to a 20 minute wait. . .why? They are understaffed - sorry. 

Wait time was 5-10 mins so not so bad but, oh sorry ""no kids menus we are all out."" The host did go (after we asked) and get some paper and crayons for the kids to pass the time - good thing because there was a lot of it coming unbeknownst to us. 

Our table was sticky (server was glad to wipe it down after we asked) and there were at least 3 other un-bussed tables in our section alone. I'll save the long version by saying that after 54 minutes of waiting, we were served food that had obviously been sitting under a warmer for quite some time. Also my wife's first entree' choice was no longer available (as in we don't have any more today) We complained to the manager who offered to remake, but at this point we are dining with a 3 and 7 year old ...and already well into an hour of sitting waiting in a mostly empty restaurant. The wife passed on a remake so basically didn't eat at all, so they comped the her meal, I trudged through mine (they did remake the spicy chicken portion after another short wait). The server was very apologetic, but I felt like management was more just doing what was required than truly sorry for the experience. I am a rewards member and we tend to visit PF CHANGS often, but I don't know that I will be so fast to return to the West End location after this experience. :(",2.0,0,0

Once inside, the coffee is nice, strong La Colombe and they're happy to bring soy milk if you want it. There's a big old menu. My favorite things on it are mac n cheese and pumpkin pancakes, which have apples and cinnamon and are delightful. My least favorite things are the biscuits, which might be cool if you've never traveled south of Delaware, but are much closer to scones in texture and flavor. What a bummer.

"I have mixed feelings about giving Juju two stars. My first experience there with Julie was great. Unfortunately Julie no longer works on my days off. I asked for an appointment with an edgier stylist, since I wanted to funk up my color. I was directed to Christie. Christie is an awesome girl. We just couldn't seem to get the color right. On the third try, I left feeling like it was pretty much what I wanted. I will take partial blame by saying I wasn't clear on the exact red shade I was looking for. Christie was great about working with me until I got the color result I wanted. 

Here's where the salon loses stars. The first time I went for my new color, bleach got all over the back of my black t shirt. I didn't realize it until my friend pointed it out later that night. Luckily it wasn't a very nice t shirt, so I let it go. When I went back the following week to achieve the color I was looking for, red hair dye got all over my new aqua colored leather purse. Employees at the salon worked to get the color out of the leather, but they rubbed it raw. And there's still a reddish pinkish hue on the bag. I was so sad. 

I've debated on what type of review to give Juju since my purse debacle. I really like the vibe of this salon. Ultimately, I'm disappointed that my new summer purse was ruined.

On the other hand, the regular and sweet potato fries were super crispy! It's hard to find good sweet potato fries since they are harder to crisp up. We also got the French Bread Pudding and OMG!! You must get this to top off your meal. The bread pudding is so smooth and melts in your mouth. The sauce that goes on top is a rum creme sauce and compliments the bread pudding so well. Pretty much the best bread pudding I have ever had.

With that said, I really enjoyed my lunch here. I would definitely recommend anyone to come here and eat. Just make sure to get here before rush hour! I got here at 12:30 pm on a Sunday and right at 1:00 pm there was a hugeee line out the door. So hurry and get here quick!",5.0,2,2
"I've been going to this gym for 5-6 years, my parents have always been members here. First off, yes they do have an issue with theft but maybe if people locked their cars or bought this cool thing called a lock and locked their things in a locker in the locker room instead of leaving it in plain sight in their cars they wouldn't have a problem. I lock my things in a locker or hide my purse under the seat in my car and never had a problem. There are definitely bad times to go here like before noon on the weekend or after 4PM during the week so if you're a regular there, you know to avoid those times because it will be absolutely packed. I have never had an issue here. The staff is very friendly and all of the equipment is very usable. At any LA I have been to, i always prefer the cardio equipment at this one. You get what you pay for at these places and honestly, I have no issue what so ever with the equipment here and I don't only do cardio, I lift about 4-5 days a week. People need to be more careful and stop expecting so much from these places.",5.0,2,0
"Heard it was great, so made the short walk over from downtown. The line was pretty long, so we ordered online and got it to pick up. If you have the time and chance, the interior is nice and cozy. The staff was very friendly and kept checking up on me as I waited for my to-go order. We found a nice spot to sit outside at the corner, but if that restaurant's outdoor seating was open, it might've been awkward. The bonuts and b-roll are must-tries for sweet tooth lovers. The SEC was ""the best breakfast sandwich"" according to the 12 year old who ate it. The East Nasty was filling for it's person as well. I had the Princess, which had a nice sauce to it. The chicken was generally nice, but had little gamey bits I couldn't chew. Overall, I'd highly recommend it when in Nashville!",5.0,2,2

"I chose A Mano for my birthday dinner last night and am extremely glad I did.  At the outset, a logistical note - 

I had originally wanted to try Will BYOB for my birthday, but they were not willing to allow any flexibility on their strict cancellation policy ($25pp if the res is cancelled on less than 48 hours' notice), even given the nasty winter storm predicted for yesterday.  For that reason, I decided it was better to be safe than sorry and changed my plans to A Mano just in case I could not make it into the city due to the snow.  In contrast to Will BYOB, A Mano called me yesterday afternoon to confirm that I could still make it in despite the weather, and they cheerily volunteered that I could come in ""any time"" because they were not expecting to be very busy.  I asked if we could bump our reservation time up by a whole hour and they assured me that would be no problem. 
 
When we arrived at 7 p.m., we were immediately offered (and accepted) a table for two near the window, but the host also made clear that we could opt for different seating if we so desired.  Our server opened and poured our bottle of wine right away as she explained the ""Abbondanza"" menu.  We decided to go for it and made a special request for the braised pork shank.

The chef served us the following dishes: tuna crudo, pork belly, cauliflower; squid ink pasta, tomato gnocchi, pappardelle guanciale; braised pork shank and cod; and a brownie/ice cream combo plus warm cream-filled donuts.  My boyfriend accurately summed up the entire meal with his comment that not a single thing we ate was less than excellent--not just ""okay"" or even ""good,"" but excellent.  Neither of us are normally huge fans of dessert, but we licked even those plates clean (and that was after eating every bite of every other dish plus focaccia spread with a tasty, salty butter).  The restaurant placed a single candle in the brownie to honor my birthday, which is exactly the right amount of acknowledgment in my book (no need for songs or dances!).

The only small downside of A Mano is that it is cash only--but it is absolutely worth a stop by the ATM.  On a final note, the restaurant filled up more than we'd expected given the weather.  I imagine Will BYOB also probably weathered the storm just fine, but A Mano left a far more favorable impression with its friendliness and flexibility in helping me celebrate my birthday on a day I worried that Mother Nature might prevent me from doing so.",5.0,2,0

"(*Cash only!) The soup dumplings were the highlight of my Philly trip. They offer about 4 different kinds - we ordered crabmeat & pork and pork soup dumplings. I really couldn't tell the difference between the two, but both were delicious! 
**FYI, if you don't know how to eat these: bite the top off of the dumplings and pour in your desired sauce (usually vinegar sauce on the table), THEN sip/eat the dumpling all in one bite.

Knocking off one star because of the service and some entrees (not as tasty). Don't get me wrong, they were very quick to get our order.. but they were really rushing us and gave us attitude for not knowing what we wanted yet. 

Be prepared to know what you want to order ASAP, but the food is delicious and super reasonable/cheap prices. Also, stick to the appetizers. We ended up ordering too much food, so I would suggest ordering as you eat. The food comes out quickly so don't worry about sitting around and being hangry. I absolutely would come again.",4.0,2,2

"This place does it right!  Since moving to New Orleans two years ago, I hadn't had much luck finding a place that ticked off all the boxes that I consider important for a fun time, but Turtle Bay does that and then some!  I've found both the staff and clientele fun, entertaining and very quickly feeling like friends.  All the bartenders are great, and a special shout out to Aaron and Corey for being so attentive and good conversationalists!  The bar is loaded with New Orleans atmosphere, and both the front section and back patio are great spots to hang out.  Huge beer selection with lots on tap or your favorites in bottles. Love the fact they have a jukebox too.  Lastly, the food here rocks!  Pizza and burgers are very good, but the rib eye steak cannot be beat.

"Coming from Seattle and eating Chinese food, viet, Thai, Indian, Cambodian, Malay and everything inbetween, this was by far the worst Asian food I've ever had. While Chinese food is maybe not as flavorful as other Asian cooking, this wasn't about flavor/spice, it was not edible. Gross. We had the shrimp and vegetable and chicken and vegetable dishes and we had to throw it away after only a few bites. While the veggies were over cooked, that may be a midwestern thing and that's fine but the sauce was so gross...it wasn't even a sauce is was some gooey indescribable nastiness. I'd stay away from here til they get people who can cook! Ps no one seems to eat there as it was all takeaway despite there being tables to eat at. But it was cold inside so be forewarned.

"I came to this restaurant on the hopes of having a fantastic breakfast based on reviews from Yelp.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  I give this place a 5/5 for the atmosphere, it is tucked away in a pleasant little garden.  There are nice statues, maintained grounds and a little fountain.  Unfortunately the menu is limited, no breakfast items, and not quite brunch either.  You may be better going here for lunch or dinner.  So with that being the case we ordered drinks instead.  Their mixed drinks are decent - not mind blowing but okay for the price you are paying.  We ended up paying around $35 for 2 cocktails and a coffee.

"I was visiting from out of town and was taken here by family. This restaurant had a lot of really good aspects, but these aspects were overshadowed by the terrible service. We came on a Monday night, so it was pretty dead in the restaurant. We got seated and it took about 10-15 minutes before our waitress came and ask for our drink order. After we ordered our food, it took 45 minutes for it to come out to us. Then after we were done eating, it took forever for her to even come around to our table to give us our check. On top of it all, our waitress was extremely cold, and was acting extremely uninterested in her job. She wasn't polite at all. If you make someone wait a long time for service, at least apologize or explain why it's taking so long. The wait staff also seemed more interested in cleaning up the restaurant once it reached closing time than tending to the many costumers who were still waiting to be helped. 

Despite this terrible service, the food was really good, but I don't think it was good enough to wait almost an hour for on a Monday night. The restaurant was decorated in a way that would have created a really cool atmosphere if the wait staff wasn't so rude. They had game boards, long farm tables, and plenty of outdoor seating. I would skip this place and go to Al Pastor right next door -- I've heard the customer service and the food are both great.",1.0,0,0

One star off because service was slow and the server I had was really flighty. She completely ignored me and my small group and gave a lot of attention to some hungover weird guy.

"Only had a snack and a cocktail here but loved, loved, loved it!

We ordered three different drinks off of their cocktail list and were impressed by the high quality ingredients, unique concoctions and variety. 

I ordered the ""Root of all Evil,"" which called for fresh orange juice. I was floored when I saw the bartender grab an orange, juice it and pour my drink. Let me tell you something, I drink A LOT and I never see anything THAT fresh going into my cocktails. The root liquor, which makes the drink taste like root beer, is an uncommon poison to stock on bar shelves but I liked it!

We also ordered the brisket sliders, which were FANTASTIC! I'd like to go back and order a full appetizer for myself. We shared the three sliders and we were three ladies, which means I did not get enough! Based on the quality of the sliders and the yumminess of the BBQ sauce, they probably have an awesome menu. 

The bartender, whose name escapes me, was awesome too. She listed out some local spots for us (we're from DC) and was friendly yet super professional. 

I'd definitely go back. When I think back, Smokin' Betty's stands out from the many establishments we visited throughout the weekend. And, let me tell you something, we visited A LOT of watering holes!",4.0,2,2

"This review is strictly for an order placed for delivery: 
I originally ordered a cake to be delivered by 10am this morning. After placing the order on Friday, I found out the recipient wouldn't be home until the afternoon, so I called the restaurant and changed the order time. I was told it was taken care of. 
This morning a little before 10:00am, I get a call from the delivery person saying he has arrived with the order. Obviously no one was there and he wouldn't take it back to the restaurant so I had no other option than to tell him to leave it. This was for a birthday and I am out of state and unfortunately can't be there to celebrate. Hopefully it doesn't melt. Very disappointing.

Save your money if you're thinking about laser hair removal. I went here because they offered a great groupon deal for underarms. I saw improvements after the third or fourth treatment at which point they offered a great deal on my bikini area...so I bought into that as well. After having completed treatments for both areas (8 sessions plus two touch ups for each) I still have hair growing on underarms and bikini. Significant amounts. My suggestions is to save your time and money and go to a dermatologist who does laser hair removal. May be expensive but you will see results after the first treatment and they will last!,1.0,0,0

"This was pretty much what the price called for.  Pretty good price for the area that it's in.  It's across the street and about a half a block from the beach, nice pool in a quite corner, clean rooms and friendly service.  My only complaint is the walls are thin as paper.  

It's hard to believe that in a hurricane zone they can build a hotel that has such obviously thin front walls and windows.  I mean it's one thing to be able to hear people come and go but when you can hear every word they mutter from the street 4 floors below you really have to wonder how that is possible without the wind blowing everything down.  I can't imagine what it would be like at spring break.

Now again, if I was 21 and spring breaking it this would rock. You'd never miss a group heading past on the way to party!  Then again, 24 years later with an 8 year old it's a whole different thing.

"It's a chain...but I love the chain eating of the Lettuce Wraps.

I must admit I love this place for the lettuce wraps alone.  It is a frequent on the list for lunch with my daughter.  I usually order a meal (and take most of it home because I have eaten the lettuce wraps first).  

The menu choices are many and I find the food above average.  They are willing to substitute and make things to your liking.  I am a fan of the new salad choice that you can get with some of the meals.  I tried it a couple of weeks ago and I could now just go for wraps and salad and a nice white wine.

I have always found the service to be stellar !!  Never a complaint and I love they take reservations and you don't stand around waiting because they seem to have it down to minutes.

The only downside the eating here is the noise factor.  I do think it is louder than most establishments, but if that is the only complaint I can think of....I will deal.

They must like Yelp because I have received two check-in freebies...

"Let me start by saying the food was delicious. I had absolutely no problem at all with that. I've been several times to the Lagerhaus in the past and I've always enjoyed my dining experience, however tonight was ... different?

I came in alone, the husbeast was busy with preparation for our Vegas trip, so I got to catch dinner on the fly. I spun Yelp and came up with this as a destination, and since I hadn't done a review, I was especially happy!

When I entered, I was greeted by the hostess and let her know there would be just me ""We can do that."" and she drew me back to a table with a singular seat - it happened to be at a corner of the wall, just in front of a LARGE party table. She told the waitress serving that table that she had me as well. The waitress looked... -thrilled- (sarcasm).

I was greeted with no eye contact, no smile. Asked what I wanted to drink, and when it contained no alcohol, the contempt was clearly there. Unsweet Iced tea was ordered and brought to my table, and I was asked if I wanted to place my order. Weinerschnitzel, with a Caeser Salad & Grilled Vegetables.  With a nod she went and took it to the chef.  My menu was never taken away. It stayed on my table until the very end of my meal. 

At some point before my food came to the table, I managed to get her attention, I asked for some Sweet & Low. Rather than tell me they didn't carry that and offer me splenda (I'm allergic to it) she reached behind me, to another table - one that had a full set up - something mine lacked (No salt/pepper, etc) and plopped it down in front of me, no words, nothing. Color me unimpressed. 

The food was run out by other waitstaff. And mind you, I got my salad with the Entree and side. Something that hasn't happened with my service in the past. I'm used to getting the salad before I get the main course.  When the food was delivered, I needed salt. Rather than flag her down -again- I turned around, and I saw it. She was kabitzing with the table behind me, Has been the entire time. They are a large party of 8. I see that she is enjoying their food with them, sharing in their conversation and everything. And that's FINE, if you don't have other people to attend. 

I made eye contact when I got the salt briefly before sitting down.  She came back over about 10 minutes later, and with a lifeless voice -told me- ""Evertyings good."" And before I could answer, she walked away. It was about then that I was mostly done. Half of my dinner remained, I was sitting with my back against the wall, my phone in my hands, avidly NOT paying attention to my food, and trying to catch her eye as she passed by me 3 or 4 times. She had to pass me, because the Computer to input orders was right around the corner. 

Finally another waitress saw the posture and asked if I needed a box, and I said yes, ""And my check."" The box was given as was my check, handed to me by ""my"" waitress. When I received it, I did something I don't ever do, You see, I work in the service industry, Tips are important, but they have to be earned. I tipped, but ultra low. Clearly she didn't care about her service level to me, so I didn't care about my tip level to her, and noted it on the bill as well. 

I hate that I had to drop the review by a star because of this kind of service, because the food was Delicious! Their schnitzel was great, the vegi's were tasty and the salad... well it was salad! But poor service is poor service and attitude is everytihing. I'm sorry if she was having a bad day, and if a singular person who isn't going to be a burden to you is the final straw... but it pays to pay attention.",3.0,1,2

"This hidden gem of a restaurant is definitely worth a try. Have been here several times for dine in and take out, all of which have been great experiences.

Beef tartare: not only is the presentation beautiful but your taste buds will thank you for starting off your meal with this flavorful tartare. 

Cauliflower: listen, even if I didn't like vegetables, this cauliflower would change my mind in a heartbeat. A kick of spice mixed with the sweet coconut sauce will make you (almost) want to become a vegetarian, or at least have your serving of veggies for the day. 

Lamb Juicy Lucy: the name says it all. They put toppings on it but honestly the meat is so tender and delicious, toppings aren't even necessary. We had ours cooked medium and it was tastyyyyy. Sorry Mary, your little lamb was delicious!! 

It may be the little lamb but it's the big flavor that has me coming back!!",5.0,2,2
"My experience finding a dress at Le Bella Donna was perfect! The space is beautiful, the staff is friendly and helpful, and Brooke was a dream to work with. I had come to Le Bella Donna after shopping at another bridal salon where I had tried on a bunch of different styles and left feeling very confused and defeated. Brooke asked just the right questions to help me figure out what I wanted in a dress and only pulled the styles that matched my vision. Without her, I would not have found the one! Brooke made the experience so comfortable and fun for me, my mom and my sister.

"It's amazing here just how delicious the Acai bowls are. I've been to a few in LA and other places and backyard bowl does it right. The menu is simple and they mix their acai bowls well compared to others who just throw random things like coconut shavings etc, which is great but sometimes you lose the authenticity. My favorite is the Baobab bowl because of the spinach mix. People love the island bowl, the backyard bowl, the berry bowl. Any of those top 3 on the menu are great. Thankfully they are opening one in DTLA.

"This is a large well kept park on the southeast side of Indy. Southeastway has it all - 3 miles of paved trail, over 6 natural woods walking trails, 2 sledding hills, meadows, two large playgrounds, open grass fields for frisbee or football, shelters, vending, bathrooms, fishing pond and pine forest area. It's a great place to take the dog but there is no designated 'dog park'. I also love to rollerblade here ( I know 1994 called and wants its extreme sport back ) but I love to blade and the paved trail is clear of debris and well maintained.

"I always like Pietro's. Good food at reasonable prices. This week things slid. The salad that I paid $13 for 5 years ago now costs just under $22. I was put on hold when I called for 4 minutes to place the order. When I got there I waited another 15 mins for the salad. This is because the take out counter person was on the phone taking other orders. Takeout used to be delivered to the counter so the takeout person wasn't running back and forth. Finally when you ask for onions on a salad when you've told them you don't want the olives...and they charge you for onions 
 ? Just poor form. They are making out better foregoing the olives. 
Hence the average rating.",3.0,1,0
"As someone with only a mild interest in tarot and crystals I must admit I don't frequent these kinds of shops all that often but after reading all the yelp reviews (both recommended and not) my curiosity eventually drew me in here.

Although the space is small they manage to keep their impressive selection of crystals,jewelry,stones.books,cd's,and figurines relatively tidy and I was able to find things that I was interested in with relative ease. The staff were very friendly when I came in the store and informed them it was my first time in. I honestly really liked their enthusiasm about giving good customer service and also about the products they sell but to be honest at times found them to be a little overwhelming. One staff member in particular approached me four times and it was getting to the point where I felt they were keeping an eye on me incase I stole anything. I am pretty understanding about the fact that yes I do carry a very large purse and am more then happy to leave it at the counter when there is a sign in place or someone approaches me politely but I hate being followed around.

I found the prices to be fairly close to what I would expect to pay for the item. I didn't notice any mark up on books or cd's and they do run alot of specials according to the staff which helps with making things more affordable. The only thing about their pricing that bothered me was how they price their loose stones. I approached several containers of small stones and asked why there was more then one price written on the tags and was informed there are different sizes in the containers and each size is priced differently. This makes total sense to me but why not separate the sizes to reduce the chance of customers trying to debate the size of their stone and create headaches for the staff? Even the staff member I had initially asked the question to seemed unsure about the sizes and said the stone I had first pointed to could be either a four or five dollar stone.

Honestly I mostly enjoyed my visit at Sense of Serenity today and didn't notice any issues with the owner and her staff like the ones mentioned by prior reviewers. The lady seemed friendly enough and even let me pick a stone out of a chest they have by their door as a gift to commemorate my first visit in. I will definitely be in again as I noticed they do tarot readings which I love getting and should my second visit go to hell in a hand basket I will definitely write an update but until then this place is a solid four stars in my book.",4.0,2,2

I was like ok, not a problem. You know what makes it better? How the way she say it, she talks as if we were friends! That's very unusual these days...

"Yes please!  I WILL be back!  Why did it take me so long to try it here?  My favorite item was my drink.  I forget what it was called because it had a weird complicated name and was seasonal.  But the waitress suggested it, and although it was very pricy ($12) for a less than full low-ball; it was still very good.  

For dinner I had the smoked turkey breast with the fries and the baked beans.  The turkey was amazing!  Nice smokey flavor while still being moist, which can be hard to achieve in turkey.  I really enjoyed the Carolina bbq sauce.  The fries were TOO DIE FOR!  So crispy, and I know they were probably terrible for me, dripping in their bone marrow fat, but I couldn't stop!

The only con was that I did not like the baked beans.  They were extremely sweet and tasted like they had ALOT of bourbon in them.  I'm not a particular fan of super sweet alcohol tasting beans.  But overall, my meal was very good.

I liked the atmosphere and the service was great.  I will definitely be back to try more meat and to eat more fries!",4.0,2,2

"I love this place. 

It takes me back to my youth when our hometown cobbler repaired and provided new life to all our well-worn​ shoes (belts, handbags, coin purses and kinds of other things).  Nope, we did not throw shoes away just because there was a hole or a tear.   

Riebes is a BIG upgrade for me.  The shop has MUCH better lighting and a MUCH larger service area then the shop of my childhood​ and the Riebe's craftsmanship​ is as good or better!  The shop has all the equipment and smells of the cobbler shop of my youth.

This week,  my slippers had a blow-out in the toes.  The Riebes expertly​ sewed the brokenseam and​d I am confident the seam is now better than when they were new.  My slippers were returned to me in an​ environmentally friendly​ paper bag! Thank you for this, too ;) 

For under $25 I will get much more service out of these slippers! (It would have cost a lot more to replace them)

They nailed everything at our table: burrata salad, she crab soup, and Peruvian style ceviche. 

I went for the corvina entree with rock shrimp curry sauce, coconut rice, and vegetable noodles. The corvina was fork tender and the curry sauce wasn't too heavy. I wished there were more sauce, but it worked beautifully with the coconut rice. The veggies weren't really noodles, but were great. A little scotch bonnet hot sauce would've made this dish over the top for me. I love spice!

The newly renovated upstairs creates such an amazing and romantic atmosphere for a date night and the service was excellent (I had gone two years before my most recent trip). Needless to say, the finger food, desserts, and chocolate drink were fantastic. I got a chocolate martini and it was not too sweet as some chocolate beverages might be, and it had just the perfect amount of alcohol in it. Things are a bit on the pricier side, but it is definitely worth it in my opinion. Definitely will come back sometime soon!",5.0,2,2
"Let me preface this review by saying that I've lived in Greece.  I know what a Greek Gyro looks like, tastes like, and feels like.

That said, Gyros at Fronimo's are a decent Americanized version.  The meat wasn't carved. Since it has some patties, it was more like a hamburger in a pita.  The Tzatziki was a bit runny, but fair.  I also ordered a spanakopita, which tasted like it was fairly fresh.  However, it lacked feta and was not in the traditional pastry (hand-held) form.

All in all, I went a bit out of my way while in Tucson to go to Fronimo's, but am not sure I'd go out of my way for it again.  The decor and friendliness were great, and the server understood my order in Greek.  However, the quality of the food was okay, and the prices were a bit high (for the cost of what is being served).",3.0,1,1

"I went to this place after reading so many positive reviews on google. It was the worst mistake I've ever made.
First of all, they will work very hard to ""milk"" you for money. That's the only thing they seem to care about. And if you refuse to pay the overpriced quote, they'll call you ""aggressive and demanding."" My cat has urinary tract issues, and our previous vet did a great job on unblocking him for a reasonable price and without pushing us to unnecessary procedures two years ago. Unfortunately, we had to move, otherwise I would never take my cat to this awful place.
Another thing that struck me really hard was the way they treated animals. My cat was in pain, but they kept hurting him even during the medical examination. Our previous vet was always super attentive and gentle with the cat, while this one and his assistant seemed not to care about him at all. No stroking, no even a slightest attempt to make the cat feel comfortable. I've never seen a vet treating animals with so much cruelty and  indifference.
They also became very rude after I refused most of their proposed procedures.
If you love your pet, stay away from this place.

"No matter what I need in the beverage world this is my first stop. From soda to beer to wine to alcohol related gifts / accessories, they have it all. If you can't find it - just ask. The employees are more than willing to share their experiences with the products as well as guiding you straight to what you wanted and what you didn't know you needed. Every few weeks I try to drop in and grab a few new beers or ciders to try. Being able to buy by the bottle is unique and perfect for someone who wants to try a variety. I have a fear of commitment until I've had a few attempts with the beverage of my choice. After I purchase them individually I can come back in and grab them in a larger pack or case. If I fall in with something I can always seek advice for similar styles / flavor profiles. 
This last visit was to begin to search out a summer brew. Every summer I find something I love enough to keep a case on hand for when people come over randomly or we barbecue. This visit did not disappoint. When I came home and cracked open my latest selection I was delighted. 
They also have an excellent selection of sodas for those who don't enjoy the alcoholic libations. I can grab a case of beer for me and a 6 pack of soda for the wifey.

"This was my first time trying Moldovan food. Between the [intentionally] cold meat, the [UNintentionally] cold, hard bread, and the bland trout, I wasn't a happy camper. I asked for hot sauce, and they sent out some weak tomato sauce that wasn't anything close to hot.

I wasn't happy. I most likely won't eat here again.

THAT BEING SAID, please take my review with a grain of salt (pun intended) because my girlfriend REALLY liked the food. It's closer to her Zimbabwean cuisine, which is notably bland and dry (to me). Conversely, I am from West Africa, so our native cuisine is usually AWASH with warm/hot flavors and spices. Just like Indian, Thai, and some Ethiopian food. Some of the best meals I've had were at a local Thai joint in Fremont, CA... the flavors basically challenged your tongue to a fight. You could see patrons wiping sweat off their faces as they chowed down on delicious curry, peppers, coconut-flavored rice, etc.  It was awesome.

Moldovan food? Meh. Not so much. Even the replacement bread (obviously store-bought bread sliced and warmed up in the microwave) was devoid of any salt, butter, flavor, challenge, excitement, or happiness.

The waitress was a really sweet gal who barely spoke English. She wasn't very chatty, but she was sweet, had a nice, sincere smile (despite the big ol' braces on her teeth) and did the best she could. I liked her more than I liked the food.

So anyway... that's why I gave this restaurant 3 stars not 1. SOME people like this bland, tasteless stuff... but I doubt any Indians, Thai, or Nigerian people would like it. YMMV.",3.0,1,0

You should come early.  The place was packed after noon.

The smaller portion is the way to go.  The larger size is a family portion.  I also wish they offered whole wheat noodles.

Update:  I still really like this place, but the mac and cheese isn't as good as you would like for a place dedicated to mac and cheese.  They now have a great beer menu.  Really nice.

The only downside was having to choose from an original and expansive menu of small plates, salads, and main courses that offered so many yummy possibilities. We started with flatbread with the most hearty humus accented by romescu, and a grilled peach salad with black lentils, flavorful greens, and other wonderful surprises. We moved on to roasted cauliflower and smoked mushroom lasagna, and each plate offered an array of flavors, ingredients, and food discoveries. We appreciated every bite.",5.0,2,2
"The four was for the food alone. 

My boyfriend and I have been meaning to try Laxmi's or Chaaba, the thai BYOB right down the street, for months now. We were both craving Indian so despite the overall Yelpers recommendations towards the thai experience, we took the warnings about bad service with a grain of salt and made our way in. 

Laxmi's is a window-front restaurant, nestled in as the bookend of restaurant choices along Main Street.  Decor is simple with maroon table linens and two and four seat tables scattered. At the 8 pm hour we arrived, diners were sparce. We were greated by one of two servers on the floor and she placed us in a two-seater....right next to the door. I am not a big fan of sitting with my back to the whole restaurant and gazing lovingly at my boyfriend (and a corner wall) but hey! I was excited to eat Indian. 

She took our wine to uncork and poured us waters to start. A solid five minutes went by. Then another two. Our server had disappeared into the back kitchen and had yet to return. In the meantime, another couple had walked in, was seated and had their wine opened immediately. Almost 10 minutes went by and we were trying not to stare as they were were sipping and munching on their little starter. 

We found more humor in the situation than anything, but after watching server #2 then stand next to our unopened bottle of wine at the back bar for another 2 minutes before realizing that the table in the corner by the door (us!) was probably waiting, she came over with a bumbling apology and proceeded to open the wine before realizing we did not have wine glasses.  Okay, i made my point.  From that point on it was fine. She was a little granola and shy, not the assertive server type we're used to around here. She also explained that she was vegetarian, so she was really unable to help us choose between lamb dishes; however she was sweet and explained to us with childlike excitement how cool it is to watch the chef roll out the samosa dough and make everything from scratch. (We didn't even see server #1 again until she popped up at the end of our meal to clear dishes.)

Ok, now for the food:

We ordered the Vegetable Samosas and the Aloo Papri Chaat. The samosas were large and were presented as a pair of dense and dramatic oversized tear drops. They were piping hot (which i love) and the flavor of the whipped potatoes and spices was delicate and delicious. I would definitely order again and can't wait to enjoy with a glass of heavier red in the winter time. 

The Aloo Papri Chaat was a ""salad"" of chick peas, chutney, yogurt and ""crispies"" which tasted similar to fried chinese wontons. It had nice flavor but was a room temp dish and lacked the wow factor. In hindsight, I wish we ordered the Shrimp Till Tikka. 

For our main courses, we chose to share the Chicken Vindaloo and the Lamb Korma and a side of Naan. Both were served with long-grained rice and a tri-pod of sauces and pickled onions. The vindaloo had nice flavor and heat, a tangy tomato base. The chicken pieces were a little overcooked so it was hit or miss with the morsels, but overall it was enjoyable. 

The Lamb Korma was off the hook! Lamb simmered in exotic spices and a mild cream sauce -- can you say, pass the Naan to soak up every last drop? We enjoyed the flavor so much, we actually started discussing an idea for a restaurant opening. Talk about inspiration! 

Bottom line, it's a great place to go if you live in Manayunk and you are  tired of the same types of cuisine and same flavors you experience in 9 out of the 10 restaurants here. Go here with someone you are not trying to impress. Go with someone you like a lot because the ambiance is lack luster and company/food (and your wine selection) are everything. Go with someone who enjoys Indian and/or trying new dishes. 

And as many Yelpers have already said, get that side of Naan. You're going to need it.",4.0,2,1

Today I called for an appointment and the receptionist was extremely rude.   She told me I owned $65.00 and I needed to settle the account first.  I asked for what service because my dental insurance paid for the cleaning. She said they had started a gum cleaning and that was the charge.  News to me????  I told her this feels like a scam.  Why wasn't I told about the charge during my visit.  How do you charge for a service and not tell me before hand, I never agreed to this service nor was I charged when I checked out or sent a bill.  She said I'm just here for a paycheck and not to fight with me.  What fight I'm only stating the facts.   She called me the DEVIL and hung up the phone.......",1.0,0,0
"Coming from an Italian family from Chicago, I always try and find my Ma n' Pa shop when I move to a new city. I found a competitor!

I met several of the fam that owns the place on my first visit. They were very welcoming and helped me learn the love that they put into their food.

The prices are about right compared to other stores of the same caliber in other cities. Here is a listing of the items I purchased and cooked at home.

A rose' sauce. It's a cream sauce that has a pink tint from the additions of tomatoes sauce. Excellent. 

Stuffed tortellini with four cheese. So-so. They are known for their variety of stuffed raviolis. I guess I should have went with the gold.

Basil pesto. Ok. They put garlic in their basil pesto. That means: as soon as it hits the air, it starts to turn brown. Garlic tends to decompose fast and that is why the basil pesto goes bad so fast. The best one I found on the market is a little Venetian Italian shop in San Francisco. I guess I'll stick to making my own. If you don't know how, buy theirs. Don't buy the SH!T at Kroger.

PIZZA DOUGH! Ok, so, I can make a killer dough. But the time and complexity is consuming. So, I decided to get a dough ball for here. Simply, you can make two good medium pies out of it. Or, as I did, a large hand tossed! I was very impressed by their dough. This will be a staple in my freezer!

They also make fresh cannolis if you ask. They are sweet and delectable. You must get one to go. 

If you like dried porks, they have plenty. I just don't eat them. They have a wall of oils and vinegars. 

This place is great. I just wish I could find a good Italian bread in this town! 

Overall, this is an excellent place to support your local community. The food is authentic and made with love. Get some!",4.0,2,2

Went in to get my feet done. Job was very rushed as other customers were coming in. The gentleman doing my pedicure was so intent on trying to hurry and get to the next customer that he forgot to put on a top coat! He finally came back to me over 20 minutes later and applied the last coat. My feet should have been scrubbed more as there is still dead skin left on them. Upon further inspection he left polish on my toes from the previous polish. I then decided to get a manicure which was a little better than the pedicure. Maybe I will try them again but not on a Saturday which is obviously a peak day for them and the review might be better. But I'm really not sure if I will come back here.,2.0,0,0

"Very impressive cupcake shop. Most cupcakes average around $3 but are cheaper by the dozen. I had the Koo Koo for Coconuts (coconut cupcake filled with coconut cream topped with cream cheese and coconut flakes.) Wowie, it was very moist and coconuty. I love when shops fill their cupcakes-adds a whole other level of decadence. My friend got a sugar cookie, which was reported being, ""meh, okay"" with the icing being, ""pretty good, actually."" At this location they had dog cupcakes but nothing vegan or gluten free, like their site mentions. I could have missed them though. Apparently they sometimes have dairy-free and gluten free Cinnamon rolls on the weekends. Check out their Facebook page for what flavors will be at what locations.

Something I thought was unique were glass containers of free plastic cupcake decorating novelties you can put on your purchased cupcakes, like the classic smiling clown head. They also sell misc. candy, if that suits your sweet tooth. 

I think they have three locations and food trucks in Indy so this has to say something about the love shown for these amazing cupcakes.",4.0,2,1
"Today I chose to order ahead online(order #'s 902119, 902118, &902120) for my co workers & I so I could conveniently pick up our order on my lunch break. When I arrived at the store my order was not ready.. which was not that big of a deal. I was handed a bag for the first order that only contained 5 out of the 7 items ordered. When I asked the taco bell employee if she could just double check the order because there were only 5 items, out of 7 she replied very rudely ""I can read"". I asked her why she had to get an attitude when I was just trying to make sure my co-workers food was correct she said that I was wrong & though it said there were 7 items when we checked out online, that the orders do not total up that way & I was wrong. Finally, she checked the order & realized 2 items were in fact missing.. I was handed my remaining 2 orders about 8-10 minutes later only to find out that they forgot the drink that was ordered online. I asked if they could let me know which soda was ordered online because I did not place the order the employee sighed loudly & started talking loudly about me to her co worker. I just wanted to get out of there at this point. The errors were totally on their part yet were being so disrespectful to me.. I work 15 minutes away from this location, so double checking the order at the store was crucial as I would have not been able to drive back.

Customer service does not include talking offensively about the customer loudly so they can hear & being so blatantly rude for no reason. I will not be ordering from this location anymore.",1.0,0,0
"I've only been here three times and the third time was the absolute worst! The doorkeeper, bouncer,  or whatever you want to call him was preoccupied and we weren't even sure if he worked there because, he was engaged in a conversation off to the side and not his job. When we proceeded to walk in we were called back with a loud ""YO"" which killed my mood. Address patrons correctly! Just straight up unprofessional and ghetto but it is just a bar/shack. After I made a remark suggesting him to be more attentive, I was basically told to tone it down with major attitude because he was ""catching up with old friends."" Anyway, our ""waitress"" was horrible I really hope she didn't expect a tip, she should've expected a deduction from the bill. We couldn't even get her attention to bring us the bill, someone else had to do her job for her.

"Hiring a DJ for your wedding can be scary. Nobody wants a DJ that is super corny on the mic, doesn't read the crowd, and that plays the stereotypical ""wedding music"".

Not only did we hire him to be our DJ, we also went through his company to book a mariachi band for cocktail hour and our photo booth. This made things much easier for us since we just had one point of contact for all three things, and he delivered it all. 

I was very hands-on with the music I wanted played during dinner and the reception, as I had very specific songs I wanted played. This made for a very long playlist and, more importantly, a do not playlist. Danny provides his clients with a login so you can easily create and edit these lists as well as provide other pertinent wedding details.

"Philadelphia's ""other"" bridge. I feel I only take the Walt Whitman when there's unusually high traffic on the Ben Franklin Bridge or I'm driving during an off hour.

Entering New Jersey, you face the brunt of traffic leading into Route 76 and the backup of 42. The thought of shore traffic on the Walt makes my stomach churn. Entering Philly, you can get slammed with traffic on 95 or 76. This is the closest bridge to the stadium area so beware of traffic from sporting events and concerts. 

From a preference standpoint, I think the views from the Ben are nicer than the Walt.  It is nice having both bridge options that will essentially get you to the same place. What can I say? I love my Ben.",3.0,1,2

The Fried Green Tomatoes were a big clump of grease with some cheese sprinkled on top. They were inedible and went directly in the trash. 
The Southwestern Steak Sandwich was so salty it was inedible. After a couple of bites it went in the trash. 
The Philly Steak Sandwich was edible but you can get a better sandwich at Subway. 
The 10"" All Meat Pizza was barely edible. I choked down 2 slices only because I was starving and needed to eat. This is basically a ""personal"" sized pizza with only 4 small slices. I ended throwing away the other half. 
The Smokehouse BBQ Burger was the only thing that was decent. Not great but decent enough to eat. 
Fries served with the sandwiches were all soggy. I realize it's delivery and don't expect it to be the same as sitting in a restaurant but these fries were disgusting.

"Such a nice venue for live music. Clean, quaint, modern, rustic, and small. So chill. I have attended several shows here. Some where there were assigned seats at tables of 4, and one that was general admission standing room only. Intimate venue in the heart of Ybor but not on busy 7th Avenue. Dope bar downstairs too. And they have a great app that allows you to order your drinks and they bring to your table!",5.0,2,2
Personally I have never been here but my sister and mom go a couple times. My mom said the other day that they charged her $35 for a regular gel manicure and she normally gets charged $30. She asked why they charged her extra after she paid and they said it was a long nail fee. She was really bothered by this because she has VERY short nails and felt it was a ridiculous response. She came home so bothered so I'm posting this on her behalf. They did a great job with the manicure but $35 for a gel manicure is excessive. I've attached photos of the length of her nails.,3.0,1,0

"Went to this place to try jet skiing for the first time with the wife on her birthday. The staff were rude, belligerent, and unhelpful when we struggled with the jet skis. Training was insufficient, and we were yelled at by the guide for an hour. Paid for 1.5 hours of time, but the guide quit the tour after an hour. Refused to give us a full refund after explaining the negative experience and called us rude and ignorant. Instead, the guy running the front desk kept sneaking out to smoke whenever he got a chance.

Please avoid. We will never rent a jet ski with this outfit again.",1.0,0,0
"Let me say just right off that I don't drink coffee. I didn't have it growing up, and it wasn't an addiction that I picked up later. That said, if I were going to drink coffee, this is where I would do it because nearly everything else is just a pale approximation to what coffee is supposed to be. 

Snuggled deep into Philadelphia's Chinatown is the only only brewer in the city using the siphon method to make coffee. The siphon method looks like something that we should have been doing in high school chemistry (if our teacher wasn't a tenure and union-protected incompetent who warehoused students). 

The siphon method brews coffee in the hot water while it is boiling, so you get more of the flavor. In coffee machines, the hot water quickly passes through grounds so you only get a fraction of the flavor. It's similar to a French press, only with a French press the water is beginning to cool, so again, not as much flavor. You really need to see it to understand it.

Siphon coffee can be anywhere from $5 to $10. I had a very nice cup of Ethiopian. There is also slow brewed cold coffee (which takes up to 10 hours to make. They start making it the day before so that it's ready for you, and, again, it looks like high school chemistry lab work) as well as tea and hot chocolate. They have food: The asparagus soup was very nice on a cold December day.",5.0,2,0
"Been going here since the 2nd or 3rd day open, when I wore my Jack Lambert jersey and Gary jokingly kicked me out between Christmas and New Years.  Fondly recall my first beer here, a St. Bernardus Christmas ale, served at proper temp. in a St. Bernardus chalice.

The 16-beer draft list always has solid and rare beers, and sours and IPAs are always well represented.  Local brewers are always on the list, and relative rarities can be found on any visit.  The heavy hitters do sell out quickly, so keep your eyes on facebook for the updates.  The bottles list is staggering and ample, with my only beef being that I can procure most of these cheaper.  The bulk discount is a great idea.

The food is delicious,  Highlights are the funky farmhouse mussels, burger, pork sandwich, and artisanal cheese plate.  Entrees are solid, a bit pricey, but everything is fresh.  My only beef is that even after eating an entree I end up hungry, so I usually order the cheese tray or burger.  

This place has become iconic, and a home away from home, for the beer crowd and people I hang out with, and I am glad we have it so close.",4.0,2,2
"Double Knot is arguably the most interesting restaurant in Philly. The top floor is coffee shop/fast casual Viet food by day and lively bar at night, complete  with eclectic decor and high energy. I've only been for dinner, so I can't comment on those aspects of the restaurant. However, when walking downstairs for dinner service that bustling space gives way to a stylish dining room that feels like you've stumbled upon a secret. Plenty of candlelight and intimate seating make this place perfect for a date, but the food is so good you should check it out regardless of marital status.

Double Knot's tasting menu is the best way to experience the kitchen's skill. $60 gets you 11 dishes (more than enough food) of Philly's best Japense fare that span each of the menu's categories. Both small plates and larger format dishes offer compelling flavors and deft technique. Favorites from recent visits include delicate edamame dumplings, buttery sweet scallop sashimi, insanely rich and tasty duck scrapple bao, and unctiously tender lamb chop robata. Service here, other than a gaffe of recommending some pedestrian shrimp tacos, is perfect: helpful and attentive, yet unintrusive. If you love Japanese food or simply wish for a transportive dining experience, Double Knot is a must visit.",5.0,2,2

"I'm so thankful to have found this place.

I love how you can see your pizza being made. Greeted by friendly customer service, props for the cashier handling an extremely disgruntled customer. He assured me my order wouldn't take long, and it didn't. Very clean and orderly. This pizzeria is located in this gas stop that has my fave Itlaian ice, and has some other things I need to try like the tacos. There is indoor seating. You can call to takeout your pizza too. Not sure if there's delivery.   

Unique selection of pizzas. They have other items too. My margherita pizza was made perfectly. Easy on the eyes, and balanced taste. The meat and onion pizza, can't remember the name, was just as good. I don't say this much, but I really like the crust/dough. It's tasty enough on its own. Perfectly baked and charred in all the right places. Almost smokey. 

Price and portion is just right for the quality. Please keep it up, this the only pizza option around right now.",5.0,2,2
"Just left here 3 days ago. We came to STL for our BabyMoon one last celebration before our baby comes. We had a beautiful time just resting. The view from the window was amazing seeing the big planes land and the sun rising and setting. The in room setup was even more nice, We always bring our own travel toiletries so no complaints there. Beautiful bathroom hot water lasted forever. First hot sitting bath I've gotten to  take this entire pregnancy. The waterfall showers were awesome the high one and the hip leveled one. Customer service was nice. Hubby enjoyed the bar. For breakfast we had room service and of course it's pricey but worth every penny every now and then and this time was it them waffles and pancakes owed us nothing LOL! We also enjoyed the indoor heated pool which took some getting used to with all the kids jumping in and out even though  we tried to go late and close to closing my anxiety was up high but they didn't stay too much longer and we got to enjoy a little cute flirt just us time. My only complaint was the beds. They aren't Hilton soft and I'm not picky but these days I'm sensitive so my little baby wasn't happy at all even with my baby sleep pillow this bump was wasn't feeling that firmness. Outside of pregnancy I love a firm bed. This one was an in between though it has nice plush topping over it as well. It's beautiful and worth every penny unless you're looking for 4 seasons then, you go pay 4 seasons money. We will be back someday.",4.0,2,2
"We dropped in on a rainy early Sunday afternoon. We were seated pretty quickly. After getting a gaze of the place, our cheerful yet laid back waitress appeared.

Best menu choice was shrimp and grits by my wife. Extra service was removing the shells before serving the dish, something I would not accept but my wife really thought the idea was great since it kept her fingers clean. The pork chop was tender and cooked properly but not marinated or brined before cooking; the cornbread dressing served with the dish was very good. Our friends both had the beef filet and each found it ok but unexciting. The turtle soup was good but fell short of some of the better ones in NO.",3.0,1,2

"By far the worst casino I've visit. 
I've never been to a casino that doesn't offer free drinks while you play. 

The food here is sub par (please read my review of Rock and Raw). And the service here is just as sad.

The games here are pretty standard, but the property looks bigger than it really is. They are renovating large chunks of the property, leaving a lack luster appearance.

I couldn't find a table game to advertise my life! What casino doesn't have an active roulette table.

Did I mention the lack of free drinks? Come on! Even the location in Mississippi had free drinks as you played! The private casino in upstate New York (a private casino, not brand name) gives free drinks! 

It's so cheap and crappy that they don't offer drinks while you play. 

The service here is great weak and the amenities are even weaker. The only casino in the Central Florida area, and it's a flop.",2.0,0,0

"My wife and I went in to Ashley in early June. We purchased 20k worth of furniture and were told that it would be delivered mid July. The people there were very friendly during the sales process and that is where the good experience stopped. We started receiving text messages that pushed our order back further and further. If I try to call and speak to someone you can never get ahold of anyone at the store or corporate level. I physically went in to the store to speak with someone and miraculously they were able to arrange some of our furniture to be delivered the next day, and then some the next week. We receive the delivery of our mattress and box spring the following day, but the furniture that is supposed to come the following week never arrives. We finally were able to get ahold of Todd the salesman on his cellphone and ask why there was no delivery or communication. We are told that he will need to talk to Devin the manager who is out because of COVID. I physically go to the store the next day and low and behold Devin is there. They give us another date for a portion of our furniture that is less than a week away and then tell us the remainder will come 8/15. The furniture promised arrives with a damaged dining room table. We get to make another call and complaint to find out when the dining room table will be replaced. They are able to schedule delivery of a new dining room table the next week. They arrive with the wrong legs for the table! We make another call and 2 hours later they fix the table legs. Now we are down to part of our sectional, our bed, a bench, 4 end tables. We are told 8/15 will be the delivery date. My wife received a text saying that delivery will be after 9/11.

"At $5.49/lb. for boiled crawfish, I thought it was on the expensive side (for New Orleans). But it was totally worth it. Flavorful seasoning and juicy! The best part was the juice from the boil.

"This may sound obvious but this is not a place for vegetarians!! Meat eaters only, no BBQ tofu here! They do however have a chopped salad and also a sides combination that you can get. The place is open, airy, and there is plenty of room for a big crowd. 

The Four Rivers bbq sauce has a nice flavor, it's a little sweet with a tangy kick to it. They have hot peppers and Texas Pete hot sauce on all of the tables as well.  The Mac and cheese was probably my favorite. What was super convenient is that they have a barrel sink right in the dining room by the condiments. You know BBQ can get messy!

"In town for business & Maggiano's was a block from the hotel because it's quick & easy. I usually avoid chains but figured I'd give it a shot.  

It was . . . ok.  I had a glass of Prosecco when I arrived that was decent.  Lots of people there had the wait staff hustling, but they were very polite and prompt.  They sent out the standard chain restaurant industrial-grade bread and ok olive oil.  

I was hoping to see more ravioli on the menu, as I was Jonesing for some good stuff, but all I could find was four-cheese.  The portion size was large, but taste was a bit flat.  They said it had a pesto sauce, although it seemed to be more of a cheese sauce with minimal pesto.  Not great, not terrible.  I had a glass of the Banfi Chianti Superiore that was ok. Kind of pricey for the quality, but that's fairly common.  

Overall it was an ok meal from a chain.  Certainly not anything about it was ""authentic"" Italian, but it was ok.  The hostesses were very friendly and got me seated quickly.

"When I heard we were going to get another pizza place on the Island I was a little confused, I thought to myself, why pizza, don't we have enough to choose from? Well, clearly I was incorrect. This pizza is like nothing else in the neighborhood! 

I arrived late on a Friday night. I expected the place to be packed, but it wasn't. I assume the crowd was probably all in the adjacent bar, iTap. While perusing the menu with my dinner-date (my sister who had just flown in from our of town), our eyes both lit up when we saw the pesto-chicken. Anyone who knows me must know I love chicken and I love pesto! SOLD! WE ordered the smaller pizza and some beer. The service was good and it was nice to get to meet the owners. I like meeting people. 

My sister and I grabbed a seat and immediately we were brought napkins and plates. While waiting for the pizza I was a little concerned because I thought it would take forever, but it actually didn't take long at all. When the pizza arrived it looked delicious and cheesy! That's the best. I believe this pizza was cut into 6 slices, 6 pretty big slices. We each were able to consume 2 slices and of course we took the last 2 for a midnight snack.

"My mom & I stayed here for a weekend. When we checked in we were placed in a handicap room near the pool. This was fine as the pool wasn't that noisy. The hotel was really nice inside & the location was pretty close to Broadway so we were able to walk. However, both mornings & throughout the day there were loud noises that sounded like someone above our room was slamming weights onto the floor. It was very loud & a disturbance. We told the front desk to let them know to either look into this, or not place anyone in that room moving forward & there was no ""I'm sorry there was a disturbance during your stay or We will look into it."" it was simply ""okay"" which i thought was odd. Also, the parking situation for the hotel is not the greatest. There is a parking deck in the hotel but it was full one night so we had to park under the hotel, which was almost full as well. Considering they charge you $36/night (I believe that is the cost - it's around $30+ a night) for parking, this was a bit frustrating having to struggle to find parking. Overall, this hotel was okay.

However, I have to say that this Perch location on Franklin Road had the RUDEST service in the entire world. If you see a lady who looks to be in her twenties, white, skinny, tattooed, with short dark hair, then you might as well just leave immediately. 

We came one day during a busy time. The lady at the cash register told us it would be a 45 minute wait. No problem. We took a seat and waited. After 45 minutes of waiting around and noticing that people who had come after us had all gotten their orders, my friend asked a guy dropping off plates when our food would be ready. He had no idea we had an order so we went inside. My friend asked the lady politely when our food would be ready. The lady got a major attitude and said, ""I told you it would be 45 minutes!"" (It had already been passed 45 minutes.) Then she proceeded to tell the cook our order, and we watched as he made it. So they had NEVER gotten to our order and had just forgotten about it, but instead of admitting the mistake or just being nice she got angry with us. My friend had an appointment and asked if we could just get the food to go and the same lady responded, ""No that's not possible."" Then after arguing for a minute how it's very possible to just put something in a paper bag, she finally agreed to allow us to get the food to go.

I will say I did not have any expectations prior to starting off on this trail, but after getting 1/4 into it I quickly realized I should have researched this trail more lol.

If you choose to go this route I would recommend having on some sort of hiking shoes and would recommend the hiking poles as well because it will get slippery on the leaves depending on when you go.

"I decided I had to try this place after having a severe craving for Mexican food. (Dammit, I hate it when my co-workers talk about food and then I get all crazy and decide I need to eat it.)
I didn't want to drive all the way to Cherokee Street and I was even feeling too lazy to drive to Page to hit up Durango. So I found this place and the Yelp app said they were open. It was only about an 8 min drive from my home. So yeah, I decided to check it out.

The place itself is off of highway 94/first capital and it's attached to a Mexican grocery store. The inside is a little bit grungy but I have noticed the grungier a Mexican restaurant is, the better the food (usually, when it comes to authentic food.) OK maybe that was kind of a joke...but still! You should care more about the food than the place esp if it's a hole in the wall in a shopping plaza. La Vallesana on Cherokee Street seems to be the exception though as they have remodeled extensively. Don't get me wrong, I love it when places look clean enough to uh ya know actually pass health inspection. But it's not high on my priority list if the food is good (and I don't get sick from it!)

I ordered two tacos: lengua (beef tongue) and al pastor (marinated pork.) I also got rice, beans, and guacamole. The rice and beans were mighty tasty but the beans did have an odd after taste...maybe way too much lard? I don't know. No cheese on the rice/beans which was mildly a bummer but my thighs will probably thank me for it later... the guacamole was good except that it had gigantic chunks of onions in it. I was starting to worry about the onset of acid indigestion and heartburn. I think I must have eaten at least two whole onions that night. 

The al pastor taco was the better of the two and even then there were some crispy chunks mixed in. I didn't mind. Most of the meat was tender and had a good marinated flavor. The beef tongue taco, on the other hand, was not so good. I was bummed. Beef tongue is my absolute favorite thing to order at authentic places. This was soft but had a weird metallicy aftertaste. They didn't even attempt to marinate this meat. Ick. A temporary fix was to drench the taco in lime juice because they came with lime wedges. 

The salsas were too impossibly hot for me to eat. The chips were great and cripsy but too fatty...dripping in grease.

Welllllll everything sat well with me that night. But the next morning? I was sitting on the commode with a certain Beck song stuck in my head:

""Satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick
The chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick
The rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard
I was gettin' kinda dizzy eatin' all the lard
There was aphids on the lettuce an' I ate every one
An' after I was done the salsa melted off my tongue
Pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat
An' the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat""

....yeah. Pretty much. I was sick for TWO DAYS after eating here! Not food poisoning just...the inability for my body to process all the rich fried and lard laden food items from Pueblito. Unfortunately I don't think I'd come back anytime soon. I mean, christ, I had indigestion for two days. I was coughing up onion flavor and bean flavor several days later. I had taken so many tums that I was concerned I might get a kidney stone or need my stomach pumped or something.

"Dumpster fire. Was in lane 2. They proceeded to take 2-3 orders on lane 1 for every order they took on lane 2. To top it off, when I got to the order kiosk they couldn't hear me which meant I couldn't tell them my order until I got to the first window. That obviously slows down an already excruciatingly slow process.  On top of that I expect the food to be crappy as usual. Absolute disaster.

"OK GUYS, CHILL!

I read all the reviews before I selected Premium to do the landscaping and concrete work in our home in sparks.  We took several bids, and, although Frank was not the least expensive, his was the best, and most professional design.  We selected Premium for those reasons.  When I called the other co.'s to let them know of our decision, the ""runner-up"" said Frank was good, and he was sure we would be pleased.

Since this was done just as winter was coming (it was HERE!), Frank told us he would not do any planting until the spring, which was fine with us.  Everything is now completed... Sidewalks, patio slab, and all plantings completed.  

Things did not happen as quickly as we would have liked, possibly because of my misplaced expectations, possibly because Frank IS busy (because they ARE good, and in demand), and likely because this winter has not been the best for concrete pouring, curing, etc... Which held everything else up.

Anyway, we are DELIGHTED with the finished product, delighted with the follow-up by Terry (the supervisor for all the landscaping) - who still drops by to ensure that the sprinklers are set properly, and re-adjusted as required, and delighted with the selection and maturity/condition of all the vegetation.  Terry was also great with his communications, which was important to us.  He told us when things would start and complete, and always advised us when that schedule had to be changed.  Kudo's!!!

SO... manage your expectations, give them time to do their work, and Premium Lawn and Landscapes (and Elite Concrete) will do a great job for you.  If all the negative posts here were indicative of the work they did, they would likely not be in business anymore, and certainly not as busy as they are!",5.0,2,0
"Every since this restaurant appeared in ""Dish"", an insert in the Nashville Scene, I looked at the plates on the cover and thought that it looked delicious and pondered if it tasted as good as it looked.  Fast forward to Halloween weekend 2010, I sauntered into this place around 8.  The inside of the restaurant was cozy(I believe that I bumped somebody with my large purse/weapon) but I was on my way to the bar anyway but lo and behold, from what I could see of the patio behind the building, it looked absolutely marvelous.  I can't wait until it warms back up and just enjoy it.  I liked the big dragon that is draped along the celing.  There is 1 unisex bathroom for those of you who are shy about sharing a bathroom with only 1 stall.  I ordered the Asian Wonton Nachos with the BBQ pork.  I'm not a pork person but it was highly recommended by my new best friends that were seated at the bar beside me and two of the friendliest(not to mention handsome) bartenders in Nashville.  Can you say ABS FAB?  The fried ""nachos"" weren't greasy and had that great fried flour tortilla texture and buttery flavor.  The pork was tender with a hint of sweetness.  The lettuce, edamame, and pico de gallo were fresh but the 'piece de resistance' was the Sriracha & Red Curry Crema sauces.  I like my food spicy and it hit the spot.  It was more food than I could eat but well worth it.  Overall this place is great.  Friendly staff, friendly patrons, great food at great prices.   I can't wait to go back... maybe this weekend.",4.0,2,2

"Have had continually bad experiences with the care of my dog at this veterinary clinic. I never seemed to get a consistent doctor. One time I went and the VERY young doctor hastily diagnosed a ""dislocated patella"" on a dog I had brought in for something totally unrelated. Second opinion and X-Rays proved this to be incorrect. The last time I took my dog in was for an ear infection. My bill was over $250. Their prices are SKY HIGH for just about every service and when questioned on these higher than average prices, the manager basically touted that their vets are better than others. Thanks.

"SEPTA, I'd give you 4 stars if only your EL Center City stops were cleaner, your trains more timely, and less congestion. I've been a faithful rider for the past 6 years... First using your services to get to Grad School and now using your services to get to work. Lately it seems that things have gone down hill. I board the EL at 2nd Street and the past two weeks have been chaotic at best! Last week, an electrical fire on the Eastbound platform at 2nd Street caused a delay of over an hour for the Westbound trains. I was an hour and 15 mins late to work in University City. Today, between 2nd and 5th a portion of the ceiling collapsed causing both Westbound and Eastbound lanes to suspend service - during AM rush hour - for all underground EL stops in Center City. Thankfully you provided free shuttle service and I was only 10 minutes late today! NOTE - These are two isolated instances, the past 6 years have been relatively flawless in getting me from point A to point B. 

All in all, I value having the EL! It helps get me from one of the city to the other. Most of the SEPTA workers I've encountered have been friendly and very helpful. I long for the day when the EL gets updated, the stops modernized and remade, and the reliability of service restored!",3.0,1,2

I had a beer on draft, which my FIL also wanted later, but they ran out of it. Okay, but the waiter just started opening a bottle of that beer, which my FIL didn't want, because, you know, you can drink beer in a bottle at home.

Server was abrupt and when I asked if the roast beef was lean, he said he didn't know since he just got there. He made no effort to find out. We both ordered the same Beef on a weck, which is roast beef on a roll with salt and seeds. This is the third time I have had this and it was always tender medium (pink) beef and delicious. This time mine came well done and I asked it be changed to rare. It came back with 2 pieces of medium cooked meat on top and the rest was well done, quite fatty and some seemed to be end cuts.

"I rented a car for 2 weeks + a day in April 2014.  Within 4 days -- a Sunday -- I ended up on the side of the road with one flat tire.  Enterprise wouldn't come out because I hadn't signed up for emergency roadside service, so I called AAA.  When they arrived an hour later, they told me the car had the flat but also another tire with a bubble and the KIA I rented only had  a ""patch kit"" (no spare tire),  The car could not be driven because both tires were bald and the patched tires were too dangerous.  I called Enterprise again and they agreed to send a tow truck to take me to their only open location on a Sunday, Philadelphia International Airport, where they exchanged the vehicle.  The following day, Newtown admitted they'd given me a car with two bad tires.  When I turned the car in, they gave me a discount of about $50 which they seemed to think was compensation for the danger I had been in driving on highways with two bad tires and the several hours of inconvenience waiting for both tow trucks. 

If you're foolhardy enough to rent from Enterprise, especially at this location, be sure to check the tires in addition to looking for damage to the body before you leave their lot.

"A fine TJ Maxx conveniently located downtown, which is where I prefer to spend my money. It's set in a historic building where I imagine myself in another era perusing the isles with some sort of fanciful air about me. Places like these are worth supporting, in my opinion, for their charm and willingness to be repurposed. 

The sales are decent and finding a good deal has more to do with you being knowledgeable about top mass-produced fashion brands than the store giving you a true deal. Some of the brands you will find for the same price at Nordstrom Rack (which can always be found for cheaper online), and others will truly allow you to express your inner Maxionista. 

If you're all about the hunt and flexing your bargain shopping muscles, then you have to check out this store before you go straight to the mall. It's not a one-stop shop so in order to truly take advantage of this store you will need to frequent often and take mental note of the quality of item and the asking price. 

This place is best for business professional, work-out items, bags and shoes. The houseware is hit and miss and the beauty products are sparse.

"I only had the cobb salad and although delish, it wasn't something to rave about; but what I can rave about are the pickled veggies. Yum!! Truffled Green Beans were the best...try them, yummy!!
My friend ordered the burger and is still talking about it 4 days later.  He ordered it with a fried egg and it came out glistening on top of the burger, perfectly cooked so that the yolk, when pierced just ran down the sides.  It was super impressive.  The duck fat/cheddar/pulled pork fries were awesome as well.  Yes, the wait is long, *an hour*.  The restaurant is small and narrow but sleek and masculine.

"We used Sweeping Beauty to clean our home for a year and a half.  In general, they did a good job.  They cleaned to the level that we agreed on, were reliable, and easy to work with.  There were a couple times where they got the rooms to be cleaned mixed up, but we had a complicated cleaning schedule.  I think one of their issues was that the same crew was not always sent to our home every week.  They definitely seemed ethical and professional in their transactions with us, and i have recommended them to people I know.",4.0,2,2

"Ordered a breakfast burrito which was pretty dry, and when I asked for more salsa (since they only prepackaged one 2oz container with it) I was given a hard time for it and was harassed about whether I asked for it before hand. $1.50 for 2oz of salsa that doesn't even taste good....come on lady, if your business is doing that bad then you should just close. 

Also it seemed as none of the staff were happy working there and when my order was taken, there was no sense of friendliness or welcoming. 

What's sad is I drove out of my way to go and eat there and I had a very disappointing experience, with the owner being the most disappointing.

The food is mediocre at best. South Coast Deli beats that place by miles in the sandwich and salad department, as well as customer service. And Crushcakes next door to them can appease your sweet tooth and baked needs or breakfast and coffee with a smile.

"What the hell are you teaching these people? I went to get my hair done here by a girl who was about to graduate, thinking she'd know what she was doing. I asked her if she could put blonde highlights in my hair with purple at the ends. I asked for the purple highlights to be weaved in between and below my chin. She was so rushed while she was putting purple in my hair that she literally put the purple in my hair from my ears down. Didn't blend it at all & it turned blue not purple. 3/4 of my hair was blue you couldn't even see the highlights that were supposed to be weaved in. I went back in to get it fixed and the next girl turned my hair green. The person training this girl told her to ""put on a toner and just see what happens."" I finally got it fixed a third time but the third time I went in the main girl Jen was a complete bitch on the phone & tried to tell me it was my fault my hair was green because of the texture of my hair. This was not at all true, it was green because this girl decided to tone my hair AFTER putting purple in it. I understand being in school & not being a perfect stylist, but these people just mess with peoples hair for fun & don't care if it looks good or not. Don't go here unless you want your hair fucked up & want to deal with a bunch of idiots who just throw shit on your hair to ""see what happens.""",1.0,0,0

My only hold ups are they only sell soda by the can so it gets pricey; the scissors they give you are children scissors so they barely work; the workers don't speak English well so the language barrier is tricky, but don't hold it against them.

THEN, when it reopened as Zesto, I felt it only fair to give it another shot.  OH BOY!  Their pizza is awesome!  The chicken pesto is one of my favorites!! I also love the cheese steak Stromboli. Their maranara sauce has a nice touch of sweetness to it, which i like.

"Great late night stop for music, some lite-bites & a lil sippy sippy on the bubbly.  

I had the pleasure of most recently stopping in for a spell after a music concert.  The live band that was on stage was quite lively & apparently the crowd was feeling the music or maybe the booze because there was a whole lot of dancing going on.  

The food counter is just beyond the bar & appropriately so.  

I like the high bars & the other table & chair set up; it provides for a more concert like setting.  Grab a bite & take a load off.  It's truly hard to balance a drink & eat food all while liquored up.  

No cover, which is always a plus & definitely a draw.

"Food was absolutely amazing, we had the Risotto Balls for an appetizer and they were great and very savory that went equally well with the marinara type sauce it came with as it did the herb aioli.

For entrees, we got the 'Chitarra Aglio e Olio' and 'Bucatini All' Amatriciana' and words can't not describe how good it was and the way the infusion of flavors worked so well together. This is as close as it gets to eating in Italy without having to go to Italy. 

My only ""negative"" comment about the pasta, and it isn't negative, but more of a heads up is that people with a more traditional southern/american palate might find the noodles cooked less and a little more ""al dente"" then they are used to....

Lastly, only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 star is that while the price was great and the service was very friendly, they were kind of slow, especially for a slower night with lots of staff",4.0,2,2
"This was my first time at the restaurant and a great experience turned into a terrible one. The server was excellent and the experience. The music was great and the view was perfect outside. Everything took a turn until I ordered The New Zealand lamb racks, when I informed my server that I've tried it and I did not like it he was extremely pleasant and went to inform his manager, Bill. Now, Bill wasn't as pleasant, in fact he turned my first experience into a terrible one. He refused to take the meal off my bill and you could visibly see I did not eat it. He told me "" it's nothing wrong with my lamb chops and I will not remove it unless you're able to tell me me something. I can see there is nothing wrong with it. I spend a lot of money on this lamb and I will not remove it, I'll discount it but I am not taking it off."" When my server returned with the updated receipt it was only 10% off the meal that's well over $40. At this point I am furious, and I had to speak with the owner because it was totally unfair he wanted me to pay for something I did not like and was not eaten. I wanted to cry being I am also 9 months pregnant and that I've worked in management and the restaurant business well over 7 years. I would never treat my guest as Bill treated me. It was so many ways Bill could've accommodated me and was extremely rude and sarcastic. The owner, however turned my experience with Bill into a better one. He seen I was pregnant, and that my friend and I spent a pretty penny already, excluding the meal I did not like. He did remove the meal off of my bill, congratulated me and apologized for his manager's rudeness. Before speaking with him I already made up in my mind to never return here if this is how they treat their guest but the owner definitely changed my perspective. The food and atmosphere was great just the poor management towards the end was the only problem. & this morning I actually did end up getting an upset stomach as well as my friend.",3.0,1,0

Waitress was awesome!  Great service.  Drinks were good but disappointed the manager never came back and false advertisement. 

If you fancy having grouper, don't order it here as its Cod.

Btw.. garlic fries had no garlic flavor.  Just frozen bulk purchased fries deep fried.   Burger my spouse ate was salty.

We finally got our food, got home, only to see that they didnt give us the large gravy we ordered and paid for! 

Chicken was tasteless. At first bite of the spicy one, it was soooo salty, then you dont taste anything else. There was ""hotness"" to it. But that's it. The original is tasteless, not even salty. 

The only thing good is the size of the chicken and the texture. The chicken was perfectly cooked and coated. 

The biscuits are different from popeyes. Cant even compare. This one is lighter/airy in a way, whereas popeyes is dense. This has a sweet note to it from the honey butter.

"This place is really great- one of my new favorites. We will certainly be coming back and I can't WAIT to try their brunch. 

Ok- let's start with the hit list:

Parking: Street, but plenty of it;

Outdoor Seating: Covered patio with fans (much appreciated); mixture of metal patio tables and cute picnic tables;

Ambience: Casual (great for dates, but there were families there, too);

Restrooms: single seater! 

Entrance: one on the patio and one to the side; 

Seating in general: no booths, chairs a little rickety. Would appreciate an upgrade on the tables and chairs, they're kind of cheap feeling. See a host at the front to be seated. There's a bar in the center and lots of great drink options. 

Service: Excellent. Our server herself was not only attentive and extremely kind, there were additional staff refilling waters and offering to bring boxes for leftovers, etc. They really went above and beyond. When I said I couldn't have the grits with the buffalo meatballs, the server suggested mashed potatoes (which turned out amazing), but I thought that was really nice of her to offer an alternative and not act put out about it. 

Prices: I felt like the prices were fair for the type and portion of food we received. We had a drink, two entrees, and an appetizer for under $40. 

Food: We got the buffalo chicken meatballs. They were delicious, but a bit too saucy for me. Next time I'm going to get light sauce or order it on the side. 

We also got the burger special for the night, which was similar to a horseshoe/slinger (depending on where you're from). Open-faced burger (cooked perfectly) and piled with fries, cheese, and some kind of magic sauce. It was SO FREAKING GOOD. We took half home for later.

To start, the owner, even after asking me my dog's names, didn't bother to remember which dog was which. I took my golden doodle here and they had to cut her short to get the mats out, which I agreed to. However, the cut wasn't even. She has patchy spots of hair mixed with bald spots. When I came in to pick up my dogs, multiple dogs were in crates in the front lobby area. I saw a golden doodle in the crate and asked if it was mine. The owner said yes so I took the dog out and put the collar on. After a second look I realized that this dog was too big to be my dog. They almost sent me home with the wrong dog. My dog's couldn't leave fast enough, it was clear that they were very uncomfortable here.

I couldn't hold myself back from trying their cookie dough so I tried the cookies & cream cookie dough which I very much recommend! For this being my first time I was a little let down regarding the price for how much you actually get (It was $5 and it was the size a kiddie cup at an ice cream parlor. 

HOWEVER, it was out of this world! I think it might have beat out the raw holiday Pillsbury cookie sheets and that's saying ALOT!! I was very shocked at how dense it was so it actually took me 2 days to eat it (it was even better the second day.) I now recommend this place to all my friends who visit Philly who are looking for a sweet treat.",4.0,2,1
"Good, reliable place to get Greek food in a land of tons of Greek restaurants. I love that the keftedes were wrapped in a light phyllo.

*Edit*

I had to change my review on this one.

I just went back recently and things had...changed. I ordered souvlaki and shrimp saganaki. The food was mediocre (no reason in an area with such a heavy Greek population) and service was snarky. I had ordered takeout and after I did, the waitress was short with me. If the food hadn't fallen off, I'd have looked past it, but it's just not as good as it has been in the past.",2.0,0,0
"Very average bathrooms. Also one time my car died here at a pump. And so then I had to go inside and tell a lady who worked there that my car was very much stuck. She sort of shrugged and mumbled something. I said, ""thank you!"" very cheerful at her. Then I called my mom to come pick me up. I was on my way to college to go to speech class. I was supposed to be giving a presentation on how to make a cake inside of a mug. Except when I got there, I forgot all the words I was supposed to say. So I just talked about my car dying and how my mom had to drop me off at college in her van. Also I talked about how Speedway is my favorite gas station. My teacher kept clearing her throat and trying to make eye contact with me, but I just kept talking about how I think every gas station employee is an Earth Angel. I told the class that I was sorry I didn't remember any of my words. But my PowerPoint was working, so I showed everyone my favorite slide. It was a picture of Dwayne the Rock Johnson with a little chef hat on his head. I got a D and then dropped out of college.",5.0,2,1
"I went here for breakfast with my boyfriend about two weeks ago. We were seated in the back of the restaurant and given menus, you know, the usual routine. It wasn't for another 15 or 20 minutes that someone came by to give us water and take our orders. We had seen our waitress walk by several times to take care of the other customers, so we just waited patiently. We ordered the pulled pork benedict and the chicken and waffles...it took another 20 minutes for the food to come out. Both entree's were not true to the menu description. My chicken and waffle entree was missing the special sage butter it was supposed to come with. I asked for the butter and she brought out regular butter. Hmm. Ok. The pulled pork benedict was not on a real English muffin, and had very little benedict sauce. So, needless to say, I am very sad that I will not be recommending this place to friends and family. It was a pretty big disappointment. Yes, I still tipped the waitress nicely.",1.0,0,0
"Won't be going back. I had the thai dumpling appetizer, which turned out to be what seemed like a packaged meatball wrapped loosely in a wet noodle, and didn't taste great. For dinner, I had the Pad Prik Khing, which was ok, but that is as positive as I can be. The server sat us down and left, not to return for approximately 10-15 minutes, there were literally 6 people eating in the entire restaurant. Many tables still had old dirty dishes on them, so our options for seating were very limited. When the server finally returned, she brought us waters, which is fine, but never even asked us if we wanted something different to drink. The water was literally just tap water, not even any ice in it. When we ordered the appetizer, she sighed in disgust, as if our ordering an app was ruining her night. The food came out in a decent amount of time, but the service was some of the worst I have experienced in a long time. The server was also the hostess and bus boy. They definitely need some help, as the service was laughable. Another patron was disgusted that his wife's food had already been delivered and she was pretty much done eating before he ever got his food. He spoke up and asked them to just put his in a to go box.So in a nutshell, service was poor, the Thai dumping appetizer was terrible, my meal was pretty good. Sitting next to empty tables with dirty dishes all over them is not appetizing, and next time, maybe I might want something besides water, so maybe they could ask me for a drink order. I am not sure I will go back here or not. I am all for second chances, but even the attitude of the server was disheartening as she didn't seem to want to help us or even be there.",1.0,0,0
"I've only been for group meetings so the menu is prefixed . It's hard to gauge a place when you don't have a lot of say so I'm your selection but I really do like what I've had here so far. 
The atmosphere is hip and lively and they have private rooms for parties. The parking is a little confusing but after hours you can just park on the lot because the gate is left up . 

It's very similar to Ruth's Chris so if you like that you will love it here 

Service is top notch and for a large group efficient.

"I've been to WoB a few times now since it opened.  Granted, this is during a ""soft opening"" period as the grand opening isn't until December '09 sometime.

I'm a huge fan of beer and have tried many different types so far.  Unfortunately they don't have the loyalty card yet (http://4thstreet.wobusa.com/Promos/TheLoyaltyCard.aspx) but I'm told if I keep the receipts, then all will be good :) 

I'm also told they'll have ""bar food"" soon which I'm definitely looking forward too.

The waitresses and staff are very friendly and VERY knowledgeable of the types of beers. They have to go through a week of beer school and be able to identify and talk about all 500 different types of beers! They also go through another week of training.  Pretty impressive and not seen too much these days where servers have to learn the craft of where they work.

If you haven't heard of this place, you should definitely go if you're a fan of beer (no Bud Light or other crap here).  They have about 40 on tap and over 500 bottled.  You  can even mix/match a 6 pack to take home with you!

Anyway, this is definitely a new watering hole for me. Try the Hofinator!

Oh, they also have wine.

Beer I have tried / recommend:
Krusovice (my go-to beer right now)
Hofbrau (main ingredient of Hofinator!)
Kronenbourg
Okacim
Dink Acker Pils
Session (cool rock, paper, scissors drinking game on bottle caps)
Aecht Schlenkerla Marzen (smoked beer! some say tastes like bacon)",4.0,2,2

"Well the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" really applies in this situation.  

We've had clothing damaged, lost, and not ready too many times to count.  We won't be going back to this location.

The tipping point was tonight when not all of my order was ready.  I heard three different stories from both counter people and their manager.  Nobody seemed to care that they did not uphold their end of the bargain.  First the laundry crew had a family emergency and had to leave, then there was a problem with the machine, and the last story was that it was simply human error.  

Its a regular occurrence while waiting in line to see other customers with lost items, or sent home with the wrong things.  Customer service is not something that they seem to care about at all.  The ""manager"" told me there's nothing he could do, except have my stuff ready for tomorrow.

"The food at Grand Lux Café was very good, but the service was extremely disappointing.  We ordered the children's grilled cheese, goat cheese salad, truffle burger, and chicken, mozzarella, and basil pasta.  We also got the warm-baked chocolate chip cookies.  Our visit would have been nice if it weren't for our waitress who was very nasty to us.  She had a chip on her shoulder the entire visit.  The worst part was that my husband ordered a second martini, which he never received.  He kindly informed her that he had never received the second martini, and he would just cancel it, since he was almost finished his dinner.  Instead of apologizing, she insisted that she was sure that someone else (not her) had brought the cocktail.  Then she left it on the bill.  My husband again calmly told her that it was still on the bill.  She gave us major attitude in response.  She did remove it, but it left a bad taste in our mouths, because it was clear that she was accusing us of trying to steal an extra martini.  We spoke to the manager to let him know, but we did not feel that he gave us any satisfaction.",2.0,0,1
"First wanna say, hands down our favorite guacamole and chips. Want to mention the good before the bad...
There is a woman who works there all the time during lunch hours, who we are always so pumped to see and always gets everything perfect, quick, and is always friendly, even when she says she is stressed or busy. She listens to your requests and forgets nothing.

Then there's a guy, that works during the day some too. Well. We came tonight to a steady, but not ""hoppin"" crowd, and say 20 minutes (multiple tables open, though I noticed only 2 wait staff) until a different young girl took pity on us and got our drink order. Another 10 minutes (so 30 sitting total) and the guy finally walk over (after I've made multiple eye contact/smile/waves) to say ""you guys going to order some food?""
We always order the exact same thing, and come in often, and he waits on us occasionally. When we said we'd love to and we know exactly what we want and want to order it all now, we say we've been waiting 30 minutes and are super ready, he laughs sarcastically-""30 minutes?"" Only way we know is because we happened to look at the clock and realize we were 5 minutes until the Tuesday deals were off. So we were sure. Dang. Never waited like this in a place, and we've both been in food industry. Wish they had more wait staff like ""our girl"". She's one in a million.

"Ye Olde Centerton Inn is one of the most quaint places I've ever been. The outside of the building is old, and although it could use a few touch ups it has alot of character. When you enter, you'll step into the bar which leads you into the different dining rooms. I counted at least 3. The restaurant is clearly a converted house, which keeps the dining areas small and cozy. 

I stopped by Ye Olde Centerton Inn for lunch, which they only serve a few days a week. I ordered the crabcake sandwich which came with a side of french fries. The sandwich was okay, not sure I would order it again. The fries were delicious.

"Generally, I think this restaurant location hasn't figured out how to do to-go orders properly. 

Typically, I'm a big bru burger fan. I love the location downtown and I decided during this crazy covid time to place a to-go order for me and friends. However, this experience left me and my friends very disappointed. 

The fries we ordered (which cost extra) were definitely old. To the point where all the fries clumped together into one shape. The burger seeped into the buns so it was way too greasy while the burger itself was cold. All 3 of us didn't finish our food- which takes a lot. 

After covid ends, I'll go back and sit inside and maybe the Carmel location will live up to my memories of the downtown location.",3.0,1,0
"Wow - Bartaco may have the best tacos I've ever had. I stopped in and picked up an order to go and was blown away. I ordered the pork belly taco, duck taco, plantains and the Mexican corn.

The Mexican corn I opted for off the cob and loved it. It has a nice cheesy taste and texture. The plantains were a nice sweet treat to go along with the tacos. Great dipping sauce for them as well.

"This place was so enjoyable to stay at. My boyfriend and I did a weekend getaway to Santa Barbara. This inn was so hospitable. We stayed in their country suite with spa bath. The spa bath is actually a tub with a few jets. We were excited to try it out but the tub was a bit dusty were the jets were and a few of the knobs were broken. The fridge had a bunch of water in the back of it for some reason. My boyfriend had to scoop the water out with a cup and dump it. 

Our suite has an old cozy feels to it. You can hear the sound of the wood boards creak ever so slightly as you walk around. Our suite came equipped with a kitchen, fridge, flat screen TV, WiFi, stove, a pot, a few utensils, some small ceramic baking dishes, glass cups, cabinets, a hair dryer, ice cube trays,  and ironing board. 

We cooked some steak there on our last day and it tasted great. I brought my fire stick and we were able to watch Netflix at night. The owners and workers there were very hospitable. They served wine and cheese in the afternoon and put out cakes and cookies in the evening time. The cakes were excellent. My favorite offering was there breakfast. Oh my goodness... their homemade frittata, yogurt with fruits and granola, coffee, orange juice, and bagels with homemade jams were to die for. 

The booking was also super easy. This inn is affordable and has great food. Give them a try when you're in town! There was also ample parking.",4.0,2,2

Patrick's solution was a can of air spray and $10 off a $180/night priced room. We used the whole can of air freshener and still smelled the stench. Also there was a cigarette burn on the comforter.

"My first visit to Cavan. Decided to give them a try after sampling their delicious cocktails at the Moonlight Market. 
Stated with the Romancing the Porton cocktail. Very good. 
Decided to go with Prix Fixe dinner because they had me at crab fat frog legs. Which were fantastic! BBQ shrimp and grits was very good. But who can resist creamy grits. 
Perfect finishing touch was the chocolate cake for dessert. This is not your average chocolate cake. It had different flavors from the decadent cake and filling to the icing it all went together perfectly. In other words get the chocolate cake for dessert. 
Service was great, from me calling to find out about the parking across the street at WRBH, to my server keeping me updated about the progress of cocktail order. 
I did think I had found a paranormal cold spot in the restored mansion that Cavan is housed but unfortunately I was seated over the ac vent in the floor. Easily fixed by switching to the other seat at my table.

"I have tried some pretty freaking tasty corn dogs in Korea. I dream of them sometimes. Hard act to follow. I was excited when I learned that they sell tasty corn dogs here. 

I enjoyed the Cheddar Cheese Hot Dog. The batter was crispy. The cheese was gooey but surprisingly not messy to eat. I would love to come back to eat this again. But next time, to change things up, I think I'll try the Mozza Cheese corn dog.

The Honey Mustard Dak Gang Jung (fried chicken) was pretty good too. These were more like deep fried breaded chicken bites instead of whole pieces of chicken with bones. The honey mustard sauce that came drizzled on the chicken, was tastier than the honey mustard sauce available in the squeeze bottles (readily available in the condiment tray station at the front). The one with the chicken was more honey like. 

My least favorite item were the Gangnam Fries. These were regular straight cut fries with a topping of bulgogi, kimchi, veggies, cheese, and spicy mayo sauce. The topping was literally sitting on top of the fries. I was underwhelmed by this dish. Nothing super exciting or memorable with this one. It tasted just okay. Nothing to write home about.

As for my drink, I chose a Binggrae Banana Milk. Sweet and yummy! I actually have the melon version at home (bought it from T&T). 

I appreciated how this place has a variety of delicious Korean drinks to choose from. They even have a huge assortment of instant ramen available for purchase. By the cash register, there are even Korean candies you can buy.

"Two weeks ago, I was at work, wondering what I might like for lunch. Ahhh...potato cheese soup and cornbread from Marie's across the street from where I work sounded good, so I called them up and placed my order, to be picked up around 12:10. I arrived at 12:10, ready for my potato cheese soup and cornbread. Waited in line at the bakery for about 15 minutes while the employees ran around in a confusion and a supervisor tried to calm everyone down. Needless to say, part of the confusion stemmed from them not having any potato cheese soup! The supervisor apoligized that the girl answering the phones for take-out wasn't informed that there was no PC soup at the time I called. She explained that they had a new cook and he didn't have the PC soup done in time for lunch. WTH? Marie's is known for that soup (at least by me!) How could they not have it? Fire that cook! She offered me another soup. None sounded good..I asked if I could get chili. Of course, she said. She got me my chili, and she informed me that normally there would be an ""upcharge"" for the chili, but she would give it to me for the price of the soup. $7.50 and a total of 25 minutes  later, I'm walking out the door with a bowl of chili and a pan of cornbread. I think she charged me for a bowl of chili and a whole pan of cornbread (4.99 at the bakery) instead of the price of a bowl of soup and a square of bread that would come with an eat-in order for a bowl of soup. Whatever..time was of the essence, as I was running out of time on my lunch hour and didn't have time to go anywhere else.

I simply told him they failed to install the second battery no big deal just give us the battery and we will have it installed out in Utah. He went got the service manager and they came back with some paper saying they have 2 volt meter results proving they installed the battery. Then they told me someone must have stole it. The trailer was never out of my site after I bought to the point I noticed the second battery never got installed. 
You would think that the service department would be cable to verify inventory and see that they are one battery over.

"My goodness. Two bad reviews in January.  I think it's necessary to note that the office underwent a lot of changes and the new manager wasn't trained since the past manager just left without notice.  There were a few mixups but they were quickly fixed.  As far as the dog poop issue - it's impossible for the management to have a 24/7 lookout for dog poop perps.  It's not difficult to see who doesn't pick up and then shoot an anonymous text to the office. That's not work; that's common courtesy.  When I see something awry in the area, I tell them because they can't be everywhere 24/7.  The maintenance crew is very friendly and they are willing to help out when it's needed.  There was a rule put in place saying that you will be fined if you leave your garbage outside without the proper container, or if you leave it out all day.  I moved in back in July and I have found a few things to be annoying, but once I reported them, they were fixed. 

I don't work for the establishment, though it may seem that I do since I'm writing such a supportive review. I have recommended this property to multiple friends and they're all happy.  It seems that those who find issue with everything, and would rather resort to compliaining on an open forum rather than being proactive, are usually the individuals who blast these kinds of sites.  

Grow up, people.  A property is only as nice as the people who live there. If you moved in here, hoping to be waited on hand and foot, go find a hotel with room service and live there. Geez.",5.0,2,0
"The owner is very sweet and accommodating.  She does an excellent job with alterations.  My dry cleaning was excellently done.  The best part is the quick turnaround time and price.

"Growing up in Roselle Illinois I have had my fair share of Rosatis Pizza. I truly was looking forward to reliving a few childhood experiences when I noticed they opened in Valrico. 

In the past two weeks I've had Rosati's twice. The first was one of those Friday night cravings for deep dish. With only a few options in the area I saw Rosati's on the delivery app for the first time. I wasn't disappointed, although not the best that Chicago has in the way of deep dish, they certainly represented for a nostalgic trip in time.

A great cheese to sauce ratio, generous with the toppings and the crust was pretty darn good. Ordered the pizza Sausage, pepperoni and onion. My biggest complaint would be the pepperoni lacked any flavor the sausage overwhelmed the meat ratio. Delivery time through Grub Hub was excellent. If I stopped and wrote my review now it would have scored a solid 4.

My second Rosati's visit we decided we were going to embrace a little more Chicago in the meal. First my mistake was thinking this Rosati's was like home and had dine in. Definitely my bad! We went and and found out it's take out only. No point deduction just a change of plans. We decided to order a thin with the same toppings, large salad and Italian Beefs to share. 

Service at the counter is slightly impersonal just a matter of ordering and waiting. By no means rude but just there to get your order. After placing my order we headed to Publix for beer and soda to kill the 25 minutes wait. Typical order time no big deal. After getting back from Publix a half hour later unfortunately we waited another 20 minutes for our order.

We started with the Italian Beefs upon opening them we noticed there was no gardinara peppers on them. Weird since they sell bottles of them to go you would think they would have some on the signature item they are for? I checked the bag to see if they put them on the side, a big no. The Italians are good but not Chicago good. Disappointed I wouldn't order the beef again. Next we shared the salad. It was adequate, healthy size, fresh and certainly respectable. 

Finally the thin crust, Hugh disappointment. First they seem to load the darn toppings on in the center. The amount of cheese and sausage targeted on the center effected the oil that saturated the crust. This didn't allow the crust to cook properly. So the end pieces were crisp with no toppings the center pieces were doughy oily that fell apart when trying to pick them up. Oh again with the pepperoni, no taste! 

Upon reflection will I go back? Yes, with the understanding I go there for the deep dish only and not order it with pepperoni. It's still nice to have them in the neighborhood.",3.0,1,2
"An excellent greasy spoon located right on Bourbon street - perfect for an early-morning fuel-up or a late-night hangover cure.

My boyfriend and I ate here a couple of times on our trip - since it's open 24 hours a day, it was an extremely convenient place to grab a bite to eat. I had the build-your-own burger, which was excellent - they cook and assemble your food right behind the counter, so it was nice to see how the process works. I also had the gravy and biscuits, which were less good... then again, I am used to the gravy and biscuits from my grandpa - who grew up in the south, so maybe I'm a bit biased.

Like most of New Orleans, the service here was consistently friendly - though it was definitely no frills, i.e. don't expect anyone here to kiss your ass. I'm sure they've seen their fair share of idiotic, entitled tourists and they certainly don't need (or, let's not kid ourselves here, HAVE) to put up with it to get business.",5.0,2,2

"Ooz....itzzz good....

1 PM on a Saturday. 
Cute but squishy restaurant. 
Bad when you're seated next to destructive toddlers. Loud, destructive smallies. 

With a ***restaurant.com gift certificate*** in hand, GF and I went for the  ceviche appetizer,  which was a symphony of shrimp, flounder, and mango. We all but took the dish to our lips to slurp down the juices ($10). 

From the lunch menu, we split the ""giant chalupa"" ($11). It was NOT ginormous but very, very well presented with a flamboyant pink and green salad, hot steak fajita-like strips on top of mushed refried beans and a creamy white sauce. Impossible to eat like a lady. 

And THEN. The ricotta-cheese tart ($5). This small guy was accompanied by a lone strawberry, chocolate streaks on the plate (finger-slipping time!), and a few blueberries. In three spoonfuls, and a begrudging, ""This is your blueberry..."" it was gone.

Presentation
Flexible ambience

"On our brisk ascent up the stairs of Vetri's tiny row home, I caught a glance of the potted plants, neatly kept shutters, and modestly proportioned sign.  A quiet confidence that does very little to give away the quality of food within.

A small dining room with an even smaller capacity for parties of 6, it took a while to coordinate our visit.  Decor is well coordinated and actually quite demure given the price tag.  A relaxing, welcoming atmosphere that helps detach you from the center city bustle.  Service is excellent, no surprise there.
  
Some things I remember from the meal.  A platter of bite sized cured meats, foie gras, and salad was first.  Served family style, it was a good way to try a lot of small items and get things started.

Little monkfish, fried whole, arrived in the table center.  No need to coax us in with the deftly intact lore hovering over its grouchy under bite, the presentation was all the enticing we needed.  Delicious, creative, and a perfect fish to serve whole since the edible area is free of bones. 

Asparagus flan tagged along with the monkfish, and really got overshadowed in spite of being smooth and flavorful.

Sweet onion crepe with truffle fondue was delicious and among the consensus favorites.  

Lamb Chorizo with fava and mint.  Subtle kick, excellent when there was a mint-heavy bite.

Spinach gnocchi with brown butter was a table favorite with its deep green color.

Almond Tortellini with truffle sauce.  Like an almond cookie in delicate pasta, it was interesting despite being a little less complex than some other courses.

Braised veal breat with endive salad was good on its own, but the Barolo pairing really helped take it to the next level.  

Speaking of wine, we opted for the grand pairing and for the most part it was outstanding.  An nice mix of wines focusing mainly on Italy and its immediate neighbors, they were an excellent complement to the food.  Passito with dessert was exactly what I was hoping for.

Vetri really stuck to a strong Italian inspiration in their dishes, which may seem kind of obvious, but at the same time the drive for creativity and presentation at this level of restaurant can at times strip out all traditional cultural references from the food.  I liked that they retained some of that feeling, even though it sometimes left the dishes suffering from a shallower flavor.
 
Pacing was perfect, translating to just over 3 hours.
 
Some dishes weren't as big of a hit, but that happens even at the best places.  It can be hard to tell where a great restaurant leaves off and great company kicks in sometimes.  I'll say that we undoubtedly had a fantastic time, and I feel confident saying Vetri is among the best dining experiences in the Philadelphia region.",5.0,2,2

"We just started going to Johnny Grits in NPR about a month ago, and have become ""regulars"", eating there about once or twice a week. But after this past week, I am having my doubts. One thing I would caution anyone going there is that consistency seems to be a problem. We have had great service on some occasions, and we have also had very negligent and uncaring service on other occasions. We have had great food, where everything was piping hot, fresh, and home-made, and terrible food, where the fried chicken was tough, chewy and dry and the fruit cup was literally brown and rotten. We told our waiter about the fruit cup, and he just shrugged and said it was really hard for them to keep the fruit fresh. He did not offer to get me something else instead. So it was 11.95 for dry, chewy, tough fried chicken (two very small pieces, which was weird because most of their serving sizes are very good), mac and cheese with runny sauce (all the other times we had mac and cheese there it was great), and a spoiled, brown fruit cup. We called and spoke to someone by the name of Chris, who supposedly was the brand new owner. Chris sounded very skittish and nervous, and could not wait to get me off the phone, even though I told him the reason I was calling was because I really like the restaurant and don't want to see it go downhill. I was not bitchy or mean. I was really sweet to him. I stressed that I really liked the restaurant and thought he would want to know about my concerns about the consistency of the food quality and service. He was nice enough, but came across really strange and very, very nervous. He said he was the new owner and had only been there two weeks. So, FYI.",3.0,1,0
"Oh my goodness where do I begin!? Well, I have just recently switched my dentist and let me tell you why. 

When I was 23 I go in for a cleaning and a check up. After having 2 kiddos, it's always good to get a cleaning to help ease inflammation on the gums. Well, let me tell you I go in, get told I have periodontal disease. You have got to be kidding me! At 23!? Highly unlikely right? I watched videos in the room about periodontal disease and different treatment options. Then the assistant comes in to tell me that the dentist and hygenist would be in to talk with me about everything. So the hygenist comes in and tells me she finds all of these problems within my gums. And that I needed grafting to restore my gums. The dentist there proceeded to tell me that if I did nothing about my condition I would lose my teeth by the time I am 25. Well, naturally there went my water works. I was bawling. I mean come on I just had a baby. You expect me to be emotionally together? Not likely. So i had asked for an estimate of everything that needed to be done. It came out to 5800.00! And that was for the perio treatment that doesn't count my ""basic"" work I needed (fillings,deep clean, etc)

 In addition to that I was told that I needed to have a couple of fillings done. So i went ahead and got only 1 for the time being. You would think routine and no big deal. Especially since I was numbed to no end. Literally. Although the procedure was pretty quick, I was numb for well over 6 hours. I had called to see if it was normal. Get told yes it's fine. After it wore off I was experiencing sensitivity whenever I bit down, talked, or even drank anything. I call them again. They tell me to come on in and have it checked. Okay awesome. Until I get told that it is fine and it was filled correctly that my tooth was just hypersensitive. I felt as though I was being brushed off. So i hesitated on going back. 

6 months pass. I'm now 24 at this point. But was pretty self concious to the point where i wouldnt smile anymore. I was scared to have people look at my teeth. So i had decided to get a second opinion. It was then I went to my currently new dentist, had a complete exam with xrays. And guess what. Member that filling I had done? Well, my xray showed that there was decay left over in that tooth underneath the filling I received. The leftover decay had spread to my nerve over that 6 month period. so now I need a root canal on that tooth. SERIOUSLY!? How does a dentist leave decay in a tooth!? What were you planning for this to happen?? So that I would have to go back and dish out even more money? Not cool!! And by the way, fun fact from my new dentist, I DO NOT HAVE PERIODONTAL DISEASE. I was falsely diagnosed! Wow. Good job dental village. Not only are you falsely diagnosing your patients, you are also doing half of the work and are after people's money. That being said not one of you should be in this field. I will never go back here again. Never. I don't care. I even advised my family and friends to stay away. And judging by other reviews on here, they seem highly excited to diagnose everyone with periodontal disease and aim for high estimates. Not cool.",1.0,0,2
"Went here for a business dinner; 15 of us.

Atmosphere is great; servers were great; they added to the experience. (despite getting my order wrong)

Wine list; great options there across various price points.

Food, this is where they get the 2 stars.

I ordered the Bootlegger rib-eye and ended up with the Cowboy rib-eye.

The Bootlegger was supposed to be blackened; should have been a tip off to the server when I ended up with a grilled rib-eye.  Note, the girl (teenager) sitting next me, who ordered the same thing didn't get it.

On me, I didn't bring it up.  Figured it'd be good, no need to change it.

Maybe I should have because while it was a good cut of meat; there wasn't any flavor to it. The teenager, wholeheartedly agreed with me.

No salt or pepper; just a steak off the grill.

The others seemed happy with the special they got; bone in filet.

"The first time I went to Century Grill was just for drinks and it was around Halloween. They tried to do the cutesy decorating in the lounge and it looked like the staff members were going to go out for a party as they were all dressed up and sitting at the bar. You know they are staff members when there are several open tables, but they chose to sit at the bar. It was my friend's birthday so I didn't really pay too much attention to anything else. The drinks were fine.

The second time I actually went for dinner with a friend. Century Grill is known for grilling things, especially Alberta beef. So I had the filet with mashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day. The food was good. It was quite similar quality to the Keg except that Century Grill tries to be trendier and is more expensive. Plus our server, oh boy, ha-ha our server... He was special. He needed to learn how to take cues on when people are ready to order. He came over probably every 15 minutes during the entire time we were there. It was almost impossible to keep a conversation going between the two of us with him interupting all the time. However many times you check up on us does not equal good service.

The pork egg rolls were really good, along with the fish sauce.

"This chef won a James Beard award? I'm having a hard time buying it.  It was a decent meal, but was by no means great, and for 30 bucks a plate, I'd expect more from a chef who won the Heisman Trophy of cooking.  I guess this dude is the Matt Leinart of James Beard award winners.  In three years he'll be sous-chef in a Western Sizzlin somewhere in Buffalo.

The appetizers were probably the best part of my Husk experience.  The rice griddle pancake things were great - crunchy on the outside with a creamy, flavorful middle.  The pimento cheese that accompanied the dish was also solid.    The heirloom tomatoes were good but unfortunately I did not read the entire description , for when they arrived, they were sitting in a pool of the most offensive member of the redneck condiment trifecta - ranch dressing.  The tomatoes were so tasty in their own rite; they did not need to be white-trashed.  But that was my fault for not reading.  Husk also offered a crispy pig ear which I wanted to try badly, but my squeamish counterparts were not interested.  My loss.

And of course the complimentary rolls that were passed to every table...except ours.  They smelled really good, though.  Would've liked to have had a couple of those to accompany my fish hunk.

Honestly, nothing on the entrée menu really jumped out at me. It read like a standard country club meal - some fish, a chicken, a red meat, and vegetables - which is FINE as long as you keep it interesting in some way.  They really didn't.  I had a hard time choosing dinner simply because none if it sounded that great.   I ended up choosing grouper that came atop creamed corn.  And that is the day I learned creamed corn and fish don't go together.  The texture can best be described as lumpy fish pudding.  Not for me.  The fish flavor was pretty good.  I tried to sweep away as much corn pudding as possible and concentrate on the fish. The two other diners at my table got swordfish.  More like suckfish!  No seriously, though, it was honestly pretty chewy.  I was happy with my pudding-fish after I tried that jazz.

Dessert time was identify crisis time.  Rice pudding, buttermilk pie, and cheese.  So, if these items were represented by people of the world we would have a British chap, Aunt Jemima, and...I don't even know what...a douchebag Frenchman, I guess.   For obvious reasons, I didn't want to follow up chunky fish pudding with chunky British pudding.  Plus, it had raisins and raisins make me poop.  And it isn't Thanksgiving, so I'm not in the mood for buttermilk pie.  And cheese is not a dessert.  It's like in English class when you needed your essay to be 500 words and you only had 475 so you throw in 25 words of filler.  Cheese is filler.  It is the ultimate dessert copout with pears taking the second place slot.  Plus, there was no chocolate option, which is FINE if you can get away with it.  Husk didn't get away with it.  If your dessert menu is going to be that substandard just put SOMETHING chocolate on there.  Chocolate cake. Fine. Done. Now gimme it.

Overall, wasn't super impressed.  I would consider going back for lunch but probably not dinner.  Go to Silo instead.

We got a pork and onion Po' Boy. All the sandwiches come heaped with coleslaw and ""Voodoo Mayo."" All the sandwiches also come with a free drink and free unlimited sides. Say whaaaa?? How you could even finish a soda and even one side after eating one of these massive sandwiches is totally beyond me. The sides were super super spicy (I think we got a tomato stew and a garlic stew of some sort).

It's inside the City Market. As visitors, we didn't realize this and circled the block like 3 times trying to figure it out.",4.0,2,2

"I just after getting an oil change. I had the gaul to ask if the tire pressure was checked. I was told @ the desk ""yes"". And was told to make sure w/ the mechanic. When I dud, he said ""no"". Then some guy asks if the alert was on, I said, ""no"", but could they check. He said ""no"" and proceeded to tell me that the sensors in this car (my car) are sensitive that you should not put air in until the alert goes on. Then I got in and the OIL alert was still on. WTF? Turns out the guy - with no identifying uniform or anything- tells me it wasn't reset. OH. So I should take ur word that the tires shouldn't do much as be CHECKED, and the wirk that maybe was done just hadn't been reset. He turned out to be - or claimed to be the owner, and then said I was being,  ""IRONIC"" w/ him. I told him I didn't understand, that he was misusing the word, whereupon he started arguing w/ me about him being right about the meaning of ironic. All because I asked if the checked the tires.

"A thorough let down...
Had heard great things about Matt The Miller's but upon coming in for the first time, they were wrong. The service was good but the food was subpar at best. Ordered the cuban that claimed to have carnitas, it was pulled pork. In addition to this, ordered brussel sprouts and when the plate came out it was asparagus? The food runner simply stated that they were out of brussel sprouts so they gave asparagus instead. Food allergies do exist, and it was weird of them not to even mention it with option of a different side beforehand. The ranch is hidden valley, and the food is mediocre. Do not get the appeal at all. Save your money and get a better meal at BJ's.",2.0,0,0

"Even though I passed this restaurant many times, I never ate there. Upon the recommendation of my son and his wife , my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try.
Plus I have been to many restaurants in the Jewish quarter of Rome , I was exited about it being a Jewish Roman restaurant.

We ordered the artichoke appetizer . For the main course we got the rack of lamb and the oven seared seafood plate.

And here's unfortunately the reason for the poor rating. All the dishes were soo salty that we could not eat everything. It tasted like we put a spoonful of pure salt in our mouth. The artichoke was spottily salty, meaning two pieces were tasting like eating pure salt but the other pieces tasted fine.
Both the seafood and the lamb dishes tasted the same .The lamb was eatable and some of the seafood pieces were  eatable, but the broccoli and the fish were literally burning our throats . It was unfortunate because the dishes were presented beautifully and the meat and the seafood looked fresh and the portions were big. When commented on this to our waiter, he really did not have an explanation. As a nice gesture he did not charge us for the cork fee.

The service was excellent, our water glasses were constantly filled, even though we set at the table talking for hours and paid the bill.

I will give them another try because my children who frequent this restaurant never had a bad experience , certainly not the over salting issue,",2.0,0,0

First time here. Cool wood and rustic decor with cozy booths inside and a big patio outside. Upscale type of bar with Mexican food truck out back. No waiters that service tables and you order your drinks at bar and make a separate order of food out back at the food truck.

I had the special of Mahi Mahi over yellow rice, with a mango and I believe corn sauce. I ate every last bit. These are the same people who own Relish, so it makes sense the food was delicious. My daughter had catfish , which she loved. The drinks were good but my cosmo tasted like it had no liquor. My daughter loved her strawberry cucumber drink.

"Located in midtown Nashville, near Vanderbilt University. Definitely the highlight of my last trip to Nashville. I even stayed in the hotel to be able to go here. It is owned by a separate company from the hotel so staying in the hotel does not help with reserving a table. Make sure you reserve before hand on RESY. And they only take reservations for the inside. The terrace is first come first served. Otherwise they do take walkins but It can get pretty busy. When you go into the hotel you just take the elevator to the top floor. When you enter the restaurant down a hallway, you're physically blocked by the restaurant reception desk,  so you either have to have a reservation or ask for a walk in. I actually found the reception nice and very accommodating, but as of this review (May 2021) it's still the pandemic and they are doing their best to seat  people. It's just seating is limited and it does get quite full. There's some seating at the bar, there is also  some indoor seating which has a really fun decor, like round beds, low tea tables, portraits on the walls, tartan chairs, frilly cushions, chandeliers, pink fabric, etc. The most fabulous thing is definitely the outside Terrace. It's a complete Dolly Parton fantasy including pink awnings, pink couches, the small but adorable Governor's Pool (which requires a separate reservation and is $40 per person as of May 2021) and the pièce de la résistance: a giant pink bust (head) of Dolly Parton on the corner of terrace made of chicken wire. Everyone, including me, wanted a selfie with this. It's really amazing. The food is  good. I just had small bites, like the fries and the pea toast. But I will say that the mixologist at the bar is fantastic. I loved the Velvet Tuxedo cocktail...rye, chai essence and orange curaçao. And the ice cube has a real edible flower inside it. Glamorous. Second time I came up here I didn't need a reservation and was able to snag a seat at the bar. The bar is also cute and oval shaped with a chandelier. So it really depends on what time of the day you go. I would definitely recommend this place as a must see if you're visiting Nashville. There's nothing in the world quite like it. Even if you are not a Dolly Parton fan, the decor is just exceptional and really puts a smile on your face. As far as the pandemic, they are observing precautions and you are required to wear masks until you sit down. I didn't feel uncomfortable in anyway with the precautions. Try to wear something pink when you go!...your selfies will look great!",5.0,2,2
"This a pretty cool place with really good pie. The folks here are really welcoming and took the time to explain the menu, even though it's not that complicated.

"This might be my favorite restaurant in the world. You can't beat it for the price point. The fresh-made tortillas are amazing. The #16 is always good: marinated pork, peppers, and cheese. The chorizo quesadillas are fantastic. Some of the best meals though are on the Specials menu. On Mondays they have great chilaquiles. Not sure which days these are, but the fish tamales, veggie tamales, and veggie chile rellenos are incredible. 

It's not a standard taqueria: no chips, no burritos. It's cash only and closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. If it's peak hours on a weekend be prepared for a wait. But weekdays before 5:00 or after 8:15 or so it's usually not bad at all. And to all the people who say the food is not flavorful, I'm guessing you ordered the plain steak taco, what did you expect? There are tons of super flavorful choices. And again, the real gems are in the daily specials menu. I'd give it more stars if I could.",5.0,2,2

(Luckily, my office is across the street!). Nearly seven months later, I'm still an avid attendee. There's absolutely nothing like the feeling of working your body to places it's never been before through other exercises. The heat in the hot room is normally perfect (every once in a while it'll be a little too warm for me) and the smaller room is never too warm or too cold. The teachers are all wonderful. I haven't had one that I dislike.

I love that they have such a large selection of vegetarian items on the menu! And I'm not just talking about main entrees, either. This place has so many vegetarian items on the appetizer menu as well. Onion Pakota, Gobi Pepper Fry, and Baby Corn Manchuria--I'm coming for you next! 
So far, I've tried the Veg Mix Curry, Paneer Tikka Masala, and the Paneer Butter Masala. Not the most adventurous, but ohhhh, so rich, tangy, creamy, and savory. There are so many other dishes on the menu that I'm excited to try.
I've got to share that the serving sizes are large enough that you should easily be able to get two meals out of your entree. And of course, this heats up really well and is possibly even more scrumptious the next day.

"COVID-19 Caution - I made a reservation for brunch at The Loft for my husband's birthday about two weeks in advance, and two days before our reservation, restrictions were lifted to Stage 5. When we arrived, all tables were open without 6-ft distancing (about 2 feet) any longer, and the tables were full. Outside seating was already booked, we were told we should just wait on the normal list to eat outside. The only indoor seating option was a two-person table about 3ft from another table and 2ft from the hostess stand with a crowd of waiting customers. We asked about a four-person table that was available and they wouldn't seat us there. We expressed how far out we made our reservation and it was a celebratory brunch, and nothing was done. We left feeling really disappointed. We loved other brunches at The Loft pre-COVID and when they had 50% capacity and we ate outside, but we felt like this time they just wanted to fill the restaurant regardless of precautions. It's surprising with their lovely grounds that they can't accommodate their customers during a pandemic. However, if you don't have concerns about the indoor seating with close table spacing in the pandemic, they've had great service in the past and delicious food.

TL;DR - They are open without any seating restrictions. Masks still required, but no physical distancing anymore. Very disappointing experience this time around.",2.0,0,2
"DCCC is a really great, under-utilized community resource.

As a local high-schooler, I was able to take night courses here, which eliminated having to take them in high school and in college, but gave me credits in both places for the class. This works really well if you know what path you want to take, and would prefer to get requirements out of the way, so your big bucks can be spent on the courses where you want to specialize. 

I was able to get Calculus and intro Italian under my belt at DCCC. In college, getting math checked off, allowed me to take other classes I would much rather apply to my degree. Completing intro Italian let me go on to higher-level language. The math also applied to my hs transcript (Ital didn't b/c it was not a course offered at my hs), and I was able to take Ceramics my hs senior year instead of Calc, which was a lot of fun. 

It is a great solution, and at the time I was one of very few local high schoolers who did this, so hopefully more have taken the opportunity by now. It's a great tip if you know a Delco high schooler who might benefit.

DCCC has also been a great resource for community theater and lectures. We have enjoyed a lot of night programs here. I can't find a way to say this without sounding condescending, but the Shakespeare we saw a few years ago was surprisingly high quality. I hope the director and actors can take that as a compliment. We are used to Phila Shakespear Co in the city (and other similar groups, like American Shakespeare Center), which is professional grade, and we were super impressed with what DCCC put on from student talent. Amazingly high quality for their age, and really innovative direction, costuming, etc. A solid performance, which we enjoyed.

DCCC offers adult night school in many capacities. Learn how to tune up your car, cook Beef Wellington, make a flower basket, etc. There is a catalog FILLED with dozens of options sent out before every semester.

DCCC also offers events in the parking lot, like flea market festivals and such, in the spring and fall. They have sports fields and tennis courts open to the public.

The campus is composed of 70s modern buildings, attractively built, and laid out beautifully in a wooded setting.",5.0,2,2
